<p>A water bearer had two large pots, one hung on each end of the pole he carried across is neck. One of the pots had a crack on it, and the other pot was perfect and allways delivered a full pot of water at the end of the long walk from the stream to the master's house. But the cracked pot allways arrived only half full.<br />For 2 years this went on daily, with the beaarer delivering only one and a half pots of water to his masters house.Of couurse the perfect pot was proud of its acomplishments, fullfilled te design which it was made for. But the poor cracked pot was ashamed of its own imperfection and miserable that it was unable to acompish what it had been made to do. After 2 years of enduring this bitter shame, the pot spoke to its water bearer by the stream one day. "I am ashamed of my self and apologise to you?" "Why?" asked the bearer. "What are you ashamed of?" "I have been able, for these past 2 years to deliver only half my load because this crack in my side causes the water to leak out all the way till the masters house. Because of my flaws you have to do all this work and and you dont get full value from you efforts," the pot said. The pot bearer felt sorry for the old cracked pot, and in his compassion he said "As we return to the masters house I want you to notice the beautiful flowers along the path.<br />Indeed as they went up the hill, the old cracked pot took notice of the sunwarming the beautiful wilflowers on the side of the path, and was cheered somewhat. But at the end of the trail, it stil felt the same way because it leaked out half its load, and the pot again apologised to the beare of its failure.The bearer said to the pot "Did you notice that there were flower only on your side of the path, and not on the other pots side? Thats because I have always known about your flaw, and took advantage of it. I planted flower seeds on your side of the path every day while we've walked back form the stream, you've watered them.For two years I have been able to pick these beautiful flowers to decorate my masters table. Without you being just the way you are, he would not have this beauty to grace his house."</p><p>Each of us has has flaws we are all cracked pots. In GOD'S great economy, nothing goes to waste. He uses our flaws to grace the world. He uses our flwas to grace the world. Don't be afraid of your flaws. Acknowledge them and you too can bring something beautiful to life. </p><p>"Unraveling life's mysteries and discovering life'secrets (<em>which are in fact neither mysterious or secretive</em>)may take the courage and determination only found in self-motivated pirsuit."</p><p>When life seems trly excremental we can moan and groan or we can even n the midst of anger terror confusion and pain tell ourselves "There must be a lesson here someplace." The class room of life is perfectly arranged so that we learn , when we need to learn it, just the way we need to learn it. The operative word in all the above is need not want. </p><p>We dont allways learn waht we want to learn. Sometimes we learn by informal, seemingly accidental process- an overheard comment in an elevator, a friend offhand comment, or the line of song from a passing radio. There are no accidents. The real teacher is you. You're the one who must decide, all of of that that comes your way, What is true and what not, what applies to you and what not, what you learn now or what you promise to learn later.</p><p>The mind is a marvellous servant, it just makes a poor master. Emotions are too often too wrong to be who we truly are. Ther is a "You" to be discovered. Life is if nothing else a persistent teacher.</p><div class="blogger-post-footer">Joe's Blog</div>
