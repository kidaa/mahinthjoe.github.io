<span style="font-size:85%;">Action Item 1: </span><strong><span style="font-size:85%;">Take care of your teeth.</span></strong><br /><span style="font-size:85%;">It's easy to blow it off, especially when you are young. But it's not easy to cover up poor maintenance, and oftentimes the damage you do is irreversible. Plaque might not be topping your list of concerns, but most people actually notice and care about the condition of your teeth. Brush your teeth day and night, and don't forget to floss! It's the secret weapon for great teeth and good breath. </span><br /><span style="font-size:85%;">Action Item 2: </span><strong><span style="font-size:85%;">Smell good.</span></strong><br /><span style="font-size:85%;">You can brush until you're blue in the face, but unless you floss, you won't get to one of the roots of bad breath: the food scraps that live amongst your molars. When you don't take care of your teeth, you risk the problem of halitosis, or bad breath. Sometimes it is hard to know if your breath stinks — if people are backing away from you or your lover is frequently trying to get out of kissing you, you may ask yourself why. Talk to a trusted friend, or ask a physician or a dentist. There are ways to control such problems. </span><br /><span style="font-size:85%;">And just as our scent can drive people away, it can also bring 'em in. Increasingly, scientists are growing to understand the dramatic effect that scents can play in attraction. Perfume manufacturers tell us that musky scents communicate sexiness, and now scientists are backing up those claims. There is also evidence that pheromones — hormone-associated "scents" that aren't something you can detect the smell of but that affect you nonetheless — impact attractiveness and patterns of attraction. In our "What Turns You On" sex test, we discuss this in more detail. </span><br /><span style="font-size:85%;">Action Item 3: </span><strong><span style="font-size:85%;">Treat your body like a temple.</span></strong><br /><span style="font-size:85%;">You've only got one body. Treat it right and it will do the same to you. This might sound like a no-brainer, but showering regularly is essential. Different cultures have different social mores concerning hygiene, but as a general rule, bad body odor is the best way to drive other people away. </span><br /><span style="font-size:85%;">There's nothing inherently wrong with not showering frequently — in fact many claim Americans are too into being clean and are wasteful with all the showering and cleaning they engage in. But if you don't match your culture's minimum standards for what is "clean", you're probably going to turn people away that you might be very well suited to in all other ways. </span><div class="blogger-post-footer">Joe's Blog</div>
