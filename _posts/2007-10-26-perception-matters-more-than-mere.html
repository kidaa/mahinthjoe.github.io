It was the knowledge book of the past in Indian culture. It deals with various aspects, from simple things as to how to eat, to how to attain to your ultimate nature.<br /><div><br />The Vedas are like a blueprint to existence in many dimensions. Various mantras in the Vedas are just about converting form into sound. If you feed any sound into a sound measuring instrument, an oscilloscope, it releases a certain pattern. Depending upon the sound's vibration, frequency and amplitude, the oscilloscope creates a certain form. Every sound has a form attached to it. Similarly, every form has a sound attached to it. The relationship between form and sound is referred to as mantra. The form is called 'yantra' and the sound is referred to as 'mantra'. The technology of using form and sound together is called 'tantra'.</div><br /><div><br />So sages mastered this relationship between the various forms of existence, and sound. The Rig, Sama and Atharva Vedas are mostly about this relationship converting existence into a sound form so that you can let existence reverberate within yourself by uttering a certain sound. By having mastery over sound, you also have mastery over form. This is the science of mantras.<br /></div><br /><div><strong>These are subjective sciences,and they cannot be studied at college. You need a deep sense of involvement and dedication. You have to wear your life out for it; otherwise it does not yield to you because you want to get a qualification; it does not yield to you because you are seeking it as a profession. You have to give yourself to it,only then it yields to you.</strong></div><br /><div><br /><strong>Today, scientists are telling us that if a child enters kindergarten school and goes through 20 years of formal education let us say he comes out with a PhD 70 per cent of his intelligence is irrevocably destroyed. That means he comes out as a 'knowledgeable' idiot. </strong>The basic life sense is completely gone. Education scientists suggest that education should be made into a play, into a song, into a story. This is what they did, thousands of years ago; the highest aspects of science were expressed in story form. Over a period of time, people dropped the science and just carried the stories. When stories move from one generation to another, they lose their structure, and get exaggerated.<br /></div><br /><div>Vedic systems have always focused on raising human perception, not on raising human knowledge. <strong>Today, our education is totally focused on information, not on perception. All the study, and accumulating information will become meaningless as technology progresses. For effective and sensible functioning of a human being on this planet, he has to enhance his perception. His ability to perceive should go beyond his present limitations.</strong></div><div><strong></strong></div><div>Spirituality will not happen because you read about it, because you accumulated knowledge about it. If all the spirituality that you have gathered is just memory recorded in your head, it is of no consequence, because spirituality is an inner process.<br /></div><div>Discourse: Sadhguru Jaggi Vasudev Link:<a href="http://ishafoundation.org/">http://ishafoundation.org/</a></div><div class="blogger-post-footer">Joe's Blog</div>
