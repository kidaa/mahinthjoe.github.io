'<strong>Don't think, just do</strong>' may well be a good idea as studies indicate that your inner voice generally leads you to the right path.<br /><strong>Trust your instincts</strong>.If research is to be believed, instinctive snap decisions are more reliable than decisions taken using higher-level cognitive processes. "<strong>The conscious function of the brain actively vetoes our initial subconscious decision, even when the latter is correct,leaving us unaware and distrustful of our instincts." </strong>That would explain why we go into alcoholic binges, drug overdoses, chain smoking, parallel relationships, abusive behaviour et al, in spite of knowing - instinctively - that what we are doing is wrong.<br />Very often, our gut feel is screaming out that we should stop in our tracks and not indulge in potentially harmful actions. But we blithely go ahead, only to hang our heads in confused dejection later. Most of us believe in our instinct but very few of us actually listen and pay heed to it. He explains, "<strong>Instinct is a broad term as it's a combination of basic urge and a higher form of understanding that is beyond logic</strong>. You could call instinct logic on the fast track! When the basic urge overwhelms us. we lose our sense of balance and logic. That's when we do what we are habituated to as it's more pleasurable. That's not true instinct. "That's bowing to one's hormones..."<br />Generally, our instinct - or inner voice and subconscious mind - and our thinking are at war with each other. And that's when our rational mind comes in the way of our listening to our inner voice. "<strong>Our learned behaviour comes in the way of our paying heed to our instinct. Things like guilt, fear, responsibilities. duties, expectations, etc, have to be factored in. which makes us ignore our inner voice."</strong><br />You instinctively know that buying the latest multi-featured mobile phone will not only burn a hole in your pocket, but will also be of not much use to you, yet you go ahead and make that purchase. Why? Because you think your peers expect you to flaunt the latest gizmo. That's your conscious mind stonewalling your inner voice.<br />Why? That's because your basic urge takes over. tells your instinct to mind its own business as the task at hand is far more pleasurable than momentary abstinence. "Whether we pay heed to our instinct or not depends on our state of mind." So if instant gratification is the need of the hour, then you just down the shutters on your inner voice.<br /><strong>Instinct is inborn, but it needs to be developed. Your conscious mind has to be consciously free and alert to listen to your inner voice, your subconscious. So just suspend thinking for a while and listen to what your instinct says... You may not land up with pie on your face that often!</strong><div class="blogger-post-footer">Joe's Blog</div>
