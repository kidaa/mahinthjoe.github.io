<p>The following is something to make us stop and think.Take this quiz:</p><ul><li>Name the five wealthiest people in the world.</li><li>Name the last five Heisman trophy winners.</li><li>Name the last five winners of the Miss America contest.</li><li>Name the last decade's worth of World Series winners.</li><li>Name the last half dozen Academy Award winners for best actor and actress.<br /></li></ul><p>How did you do? The point is, none of us remember the headliners of yesterday. These are no second-rate achievers. They are the best in their fields. But the applause dies.Awards tarnish.Achievements are forgotten.Accolades and certificates are buried with their owners.Here's another quiz. See how you do on this one:</p><ul><li>List a few teachers who aided your journey through school.</li><li>Name three friends who have helped you through a difficult time.</li><li>Name five people who have taught you something worthwhile.</li><li>Think of five people you enjoy spending time with.</li><li>Name half a dozen heroes whose stories have inspired you.</li><li>Think of a few people who have made you feel appreciated and special.</li></ul><p>Easier?The lesson?The people who make a difference in your life are not the ones with the most credentials, the most money, or the most awards. They are the ones that care.<strong>"People don't care how much you know until they know how much you care!"</strong> We all want someone to care. As Christians we are commanded to love one another and to care for the members of Christ's body just as we do for our own families.We will not love and serve God until we know how much He cares for us. As members of His body we are to be His ambassadors on this earth and show the unbelievers how much He cares for them.Think about it . . .</p><div class="blogger-post-footer">Joe's Blog</div>
