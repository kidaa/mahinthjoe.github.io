The animal cried piteously for hours as the farmer tried to figure out what to do. Finally, he decided the animal was old, and the well needed to be covered up anyway; it just wasn't worth it to retrieve the donkey. </p><p>He invited all his neighbors to come over and help him. They all grabbed a shovel and began to shovel dirt into the well. At first, the donkey realized what was happening and cried horribly. Then, to everyone's amazement he quieted down. A few shovel loads later, the farmer finally looked down the well. He was astonished at what he saw. With each shovel of dirt that hit his back, the donkey was doing something amazing. He would shake it off and take a step up. As the farmer's neighbors continued to shovel dirt on top of the animal, he would shake it off and ake a step up. Pretty soon, everyone was amazed as the donkey stepped up over the edge of the well and happily trotted off! </p><p><strong>Life is going to shovel dirt on you, all kinds of dirt. The trick to getting out of the well is to shake it off and take a step up. Each of our troubles is a stepping-stone. We can get out of the deepest wells just by not stopping, never giving up! Shake it off and take a step up.</strong><br /></p><p>Remember the five simple rules to be happy:</p><ol><li>Free your heart from hatred - Forgive. </li><br /><li>Free your mind from worries - Most never happen. </li><br /><li>Live simply and appreciate what you have. </li><br /><li>Give more. </li><br /><li>Expect less</li></ol><p>________ Now ________<br />Enough of that . . .<br />The donkey later came back and bit the HECK out of the farmer who had tried to bury him. The gash from the bite got infected, and the farmer eventually died in agony from septic shock.<br />Moral from today's lesson:<br /><strong>When you do something wrong and try to cover your - , it always comes back to bite you.</strong></p><p></p><div class="blogger-post-footer">Joe's Blog</div>
