Thats why we move our eyes when we read: we can't pick up much information about the shape, or the color, or the structure of words unless we focus our fovea directly on them. Just try for example , to read this paragraph by staring straigh ahead at the center of the screen(without scrolling through it) It's impossible.</p><p>If you can track where someones fovea is moving and what are the fixating on, in other words, you can tell with extraordinary precission what they are actually looking at and what kind of information they are actually receiving.</p><br /><iframe src="http://rcm.amazon.com/e/cm?t=m0ba5-20&o=1&p=8&l=bpl&asins=0316346624&fc1=000000&IS2=1&lt1=_blank&m=amazon&lc1=0000FF&bc1=000000&bg1=FFFFFF&f=ifr" style="align:left;padding-top:5px;width:131px;height:245px;padding-right:10px;"align="left" scrolling="no" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" frameborder="0"></iframe><br />The Tipping Point by Malcolm Gladwell<a href="javascript:window.location = 'http://www.socialmarker.com/?link='+encodeURIComponent (location.href)+'&title='+encodeURIComponent( document.title);"><img src= "http://www.socialmarker.com/bookmark.gif" border="0" alt="share" /></a><noscript><a href="http://www.socialmarker.com">Social Bookmarking</a></noscript><div class="blogger-post-footer">Joe's Blog</div>
