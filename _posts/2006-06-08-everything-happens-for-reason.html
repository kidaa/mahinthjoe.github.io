What you need is a belief in one key concept that <strong>everything happens for a reason.</strong><br /><br />Whether you already believe that things happen for a purpose, or are unsure about this notion, here are some points to consider to get the maximum results from this principle:<br /><br />1. <strong>Don't curse your present circumstances </strong>... or gripe about the past. When we encounter "negative" or stressful situations in our lives, our immediate reaction is to be outraged, frustrated or depressed. This is the start of a downward spiral in which we fill our minds with gloomy thoughts and generate more negative results.<br />On the contrary, when you believe there's a purpose for your difficulties, your state of mind is quite different. You realize that your current situation is serving you in some<br />way, whether it's a turn in the road or a lesson that you can apply at a later date.<br /><br />2. <strong>This principle is not limited to tragedies and problems</strong>. While it's true that you can find positive aspects to every setback, the idea that everything happens for a reason applies to positive experiences and "neutral" events as well.<br />For instance, let's say that you meet someone at a networking meeting. The person holds no special significance to you and doesn't seem likely to bring you any business. What you're not considering are the possible ways that the two of you might help each other in the future.<br /><br />3. <strong>Being passive is not the answer</strong>. Just because there is a "reason" for the events that  happen to you doesn't mean you can achieve your goals by sitting back and waiting for<br />success to occur on its own. It's still up to you to be proactive and make things happen. That requires energy, creativity and, yes, a lot of effort on your part!<br /><br />4. <strong>Recognize the "two way street." </strong>It's easy to get caught up with the idea that every person you meet has something to contribute to you. That's true to some extent. But, don't<br />overlook the fact that there is something for you to impart to others as well! And, while there are often ways in which each party contributes to the other, there are many instances where it's not an equal "give and take." Thus, there are times in a relationship when you may be serving another person more often than you are receiving from them.<br /><br />5. <strong>You are always being directed toward something "better." </strong><br />Have you ever been fired from a job ... then moved on to find a better career? Or, have you terminated a personal relationship (or been terminated yourself!) ... and then met<br />someone who was a far better partner for you?<br />In both of these instances, life was pushing you toward something that would bring you even more satisfaction. Of course, in all of these situations, you had the option to<br />close off the improved alternative.<br /><br />For instance, after being fired, you could have complained about the lack of job opportunities. Or, after the relationship ended, you could have concluded that you are<br />"unlucky in love." Yet, had you taken these approaches, you would have missed the better situation that was just around the corner.<br /><br />6. <strong>You'll never be able to explain everything. </strong>The notion that "everything happens for a reason" will not answer every question that you have about life! On the contrary, although you'll find that you are better able to understand certain events, there will still be many mysteries that you can't explain.<br />There are no coincidences. When you believe this, you'll enter a new world of possibility. When a problem occurs, instead of crying, <strong>"Why Me?" </strong>you'll look for the lesson you can learn, or the opportunity that is on the horizon.<br /><br />You'll realize that it makes no sense to argue that<br />something shouldn't have happened to you.<br />It did happen ...<br />there's a reason for it ...<br />and, if you're wise, you'll use it to your advantage!<div class="blogger-post-footer">Joe's Blog</div>
