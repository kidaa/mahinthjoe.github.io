Sujata Burla's life was shattered when on a pilgrimage trip, she met with a serious accident in the year 2001.<br /><br />She survived but life dealt a cruel blow when the doctors and physiotherapists treating her told her she could not walk for the rest of her life. The accident had turned her into a paraplegic. It meant Sujata was immobile below the shoulders at the early age 21.<br /><br />In another tragedy, her father expired in March 2004. Not one to be easily cowed down by her circumstances, she wanted to be independent financially, physically and mentally.<br /><br />She soon realized that she needed to be financially independent first . She started working with her sister, who is a fashion designer, and then started a textile workshop on her own but the workers took advantage of her physical disability and she lost money.<br /><br />Sujata realized that if at all she had to succeed in life she would have to do something for which she did not have to depend on anybody <br /><br />Then she hit upon the idea of working in the stock market. She learnt typing and working on a computer and laptop. She spent another year learning the nitty gritty of stock market operations .Now she trades like a pro and earns anywhere between Rs 200,000 and Rs 250,000 every<br />month <br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">This shows that human will power and determination has no limit the only thing required is passion, persistence and hard work.</span><div class="blogger-post-footer">Joe's Blog</div>
