Imagine yourself marooned on a vast deserted island. You have been there for years,   struggling just to survive, gathering food, using only your    hands   and makeshift tools to scratch out an existence. Most of your days are fully taken up with satisfying the basic needs of life.<br /><br />Having proved to yourself that you can survive with just the bare essentials you resign yourself to the fact that you will never be rescued. Anger turns to quiet desperation, then to acceptance as you carry on with your life Several years have passed and you have be-<br />come accustomed to your Lifestyle and feel comfortable enough to start exploring your island. You have settled in and your attention lately has been directed towards the mountains and what is 'beyond.<br /><br />As you begin to move further inland and away from your comfort zone, you develop a sense of strength for having survived the years on your own. Along the way you are making many discoveries that will enhance your life. You are gathering abundance<br />of knowledge about the environment that you live in. By this time you have convinced yourself that there is nothing you cannot do, and that there is nothing you really have to do to survive. Everything has been provided for you. You simply reach out and take it as you need it.<br /><br />After 40 years of wandering the island, you finally reach the top of the mountain and turn away from the direction in which you came. In the distance and time that separates you, you discover a huge modern city with all the amenities that such a place could<br />The only things that will deny you access to your soul are your thoughts. You discover that your island was not an island and that the city has always been there. As your mind races over the circumstances of the last 40 years, you fall to your knees weeping.<br /><br />The discovery of your soul is very .much the same overwhelming experience. It's not a religious experience unless you want it to be. It's natural and simply a discovery of another part of you, that was there all along, that you didn't know.<br /><br />Think of the possibilities. Where there was one, now there are many And there is always that one question, "Why?" How could I have not known? How would my  life have been different?<br /><br />The human species is a three part being â€” mind, body and spirit. The mind is what drives us, the spirit is our personality or ego, and the body is the vehicle that<br />is used to experience     the physical worid. To experience physicality one needs to<br />be physical, it's natural then to be focused on the body and its needs.<br />Most all of our waking hours are centred on what the body wants to experience- There is<br />nothing wrong with this arrangement, and it works flawlessly and on auto-pilot  throughout our lifetimes with or without our awareness of what makes it tick.<br /><br />So why am I bringing this up? If the system works perfectly, then leave it alone. Don't try<br />to fix that which doesn't need fixing. Is ignorance not bliss? These notions of being alone and powerless, limit our experience of the physical world and our own personal growth.<br /><br />With a certain amount of awareness, our lives can be enhanced a thousand fold and more, with the discovery of our souls. Denial of the soul has far reaching ramifications. Awareness of it, augments the quality of our lives.<br /><br />Your soul is yours-it always was. The only thing that will deny you access to your soul is<br />your      own thoughts. You can walk on water, turn water into wine, perform all kinds of miracles if you desire. Your thoughts are the key to the soul. As you think, so shall your<br />reap. Discover your soul and you discover another natural piece of who you are. You are never lost, you just are not there yet Open the' door to discovery and double or more what you think you are.<div class="blogger-post-footer">Joe's Blog</div>
