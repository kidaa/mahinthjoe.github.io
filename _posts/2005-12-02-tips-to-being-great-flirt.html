They're the ones feeling so good about themselves that others are irresistibly drawn to them including potential partners. Flirting comes from the old French word 'fleurter', meaning 'to flower'.<br /><br />Flirting today is no longer restricted to coy glances exchanged from a distance, with hardly a word being spoken for days together. It now involves social meets, betting, even adopting the rescuing-the-damsel-in-distress act."<span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">I like to flirt around but that doesn't mean that I don't respect women. It is a way of de-stressing oneself.</span>" A new way to combat stress, surely!<br /><br />Not just that, other positive effects of flirting are listed here, "<span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">Flirting helps you make friends. It gives you a choice to select your type of guy if you are intending to look at a long lasting relationship.</span>" But, surely there's a flip side to it you will say? "<strong>There's no flip side</strong>." If you flirt and I enjoy flirting no harm done. This doesn't mean you can play with people's lives and don't know your limits. <span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">Healthy flirting is always good.</span><br /><br />Flirting is not just about casual fun. It has a psychological dimension to it. "Flirting happens very often in colleges as it is a good way to know someone. It works well even on the emotional front. It's quite harmless." <strong>Youngsters, today, are more frank than ever before</strong>. There's no time to indulge in romantic escapism. It is all about saying what you have to say, and going on with your lives.<br /><br /><strong>Most good flirts have these traits in common</strong>: <span style="font-size:130%;">They know who they are. </span>They have empowering beliefs about themselves and others. They're able to establish rapport with almost anyone. They know not everyone will love them, but view all people as being interesting. They're upbeat and positive. They use language in ways that make others feel connected and eager to participate. They pick up others' signals, know when to take flirting to the next level and when to stop. They have fun and can play like children.<br /><br /><strong>Eye contact</strong>: When eyes meet, a spark is ignited which can be put out instantly or fanned into a fiercely burning fire. Eye contact is an important part of the mating ritual a wonderful way to signal a potential mate that you're interested.<br /><br />If you tend to look away from people rather than make eye contact, try this out:<br /><br /><ul><li>When you notice some one you like, force yourself to make eye contact. You'd be surprised how many people avoid eye contact with people they're attracted to and end up flirting with people they aren't interested in!</li></ul>Notice what happens when you make eye contact and how you feel. If you feel uncomfortable, good keep at it! You're on the verge of feeling better. If you feel good, excellent do more of it! When you spot someone you want to get friendlier with, you can use longer eye contact with a smile.<br /><br /><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">The smile:</span> Eye contact coupled with a smile is a very powerful flirting tool. A smile has to start on the inside. Remembering yourself at your best is a great prelude to a smile.<br /><br />Try this: Check how you feel in your body right now. Turn up the corners of your mouth and fake a smile. Check how your body feels when you're smiling.<div class="blogger-post-footer">Joe's Blog</div>
