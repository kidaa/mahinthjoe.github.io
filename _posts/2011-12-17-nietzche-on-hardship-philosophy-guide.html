Episode 6: Nietzsche on Hardship - British philosopher Alain De Botton  explores Friedrich Nietzsche's (1844-1900) dictum that any worthwhile  achievements in life come from the experience of overcoming hardship.  For him, any existence that is too comfortable is worthless, as are the  twin refugees of drink or religion.</span><div class="blogger-post-footer">Joe's Blog</div>
