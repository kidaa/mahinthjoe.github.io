The article Gandhi the ceaseless crusader brings to light his ceaseless struggle against the atrocities and injustices committed against women.</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" id="szb05" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 10pt"><span id="szb06"   style="font-family:Calibri;font-size:100%;"><b id="mxay">Crusader of women’s equality</b></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" id="szb07" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 10pt"><span id="szb08"  style="font-size:100%;"><span id="szb09"  style="font-family:Calibri;">It was Gandhi’s relentless efforts that that saw women becoming equal participants in all walks of life. He often adressed women’s groups to raise their issues. He was the first to address women’s issues with a different but unique attitude. It was because of Gandhi, that the first cabinet of independent India had two women ministers . He wanted women to get empowered through education.He insisted on her equality to steer her own destiny side b side with man.</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" id="szb015" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 10pt"><span id="szb016"   style="font-family:Calibri;font-size:100%;"><b id="h1ju">His war against superstitious practices</b></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" id="szb017" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 10pt"><span id="szb018"  style="font-size:100%;"><span id="szb019"  style="font-family:Calibri;">Gandhi was not an advocate of blind adherence to tradition. He insisted that traditions that are inconsistent with morality must be banished from India. He was a ceaseless crusader against untouchability, child marriages, child widowhood, the isolation and subjugation of widows, the cruel domination of men over women and women’s own sub-servient mentality. He felt that all these horrible beliefs and superstitious practices that offended the human dignity should be swept out of existence. Thanks to his nble cause that today some of these practices had been done away with.</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" id="szb026" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 10pt"><span id="szb027"   style="font-family:Calibri;font-size:100%;"><b id="m8t-">His battle against male chauvinism</b></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" id="szb028" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 10pt"><span id="szb029"  style="font-size:100%;"><span id="szb030"  style="font-family:Calibri;">A stickler of truth, his entire life stands testimony to this. His entire life had been “experiments with truth” Being a lover of truth, he tried ti verify the truth of any new thought before accepting it. His relationship with Kasturbai, helped him to realize the real status of women. He considered women as the nobler sex and women abuse as degrading, shockinf and brutal. </span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" id="szb035" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 10pt"><span id="szb036"   style="font-family:Calibri;font-size:100%;"><b id="d7tf">Ahimsa and satyagraha</b></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" id="szb037" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 10pt"><span id="szb038"  style="font-size:100%;"><span id="szb039"  style="font-family:Calibri;">Gandhi ‘s way of protest had always been a non violent approach. Gandhi related the issues of Ahimsa and sathagraha to women because they have the right attitude to practice and promote them. Being the embodiment of self sacrifice, silent sufferinfg, infinite love , women have the soul force and truth force to handle sathagraha. </span></span></p><br /><img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5252419881331060098" style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; CURSOR: hand; TEXT-ALIGN: center" alt="" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_Z0_Yj69ls8Q/SORYDbXv7YI/AAAAAAAAByM/YJOfJZJbbhk/s400/Pravs_J_-_Life_Is_A_Message.jpg" border="0" /><br /><p class="MsoNormal" id="szb042" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 10pt"><span id="szb044"   style="font-family:Calibri;font-size:100%;">Related Posts</span><br /></p><br /><div class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 10pt"><span id="szb044"   style="font-family:Calibri;font-size:100%;"><a id="x_cz" title="Mahtma Gandhi's 5 Teaching to bring about World Peace." href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/zenhabits/~3/388130386/">Mahtma Gandhi's 5 Teaching to bring about World Peace.</a> </span></div><div class="blogger-post-footer">Joe's Blog</div>
