The students responded with a unanimous 'yes.'<br /><br />The professor then produced two cups of coffee from under the table and poured the entire contents into the jar, effectively<br />filling the empty space between the sand.&nbsp; The students laughed.<br /><br />'Now,' said the professor, &nbsp; as the laughter subsided,<br />'I want you to recognize that this jar represents your life.<br />The golf balls are the important things - family,<br />children, health, Friends, and Favorite passions â€“ <br />Things that if everything else was lost and only they remained, Your life would still be full.<br /><br />The pebbles are the other things that matter like your job, house, and car.<br /><br />The sand is everything else --The small stuff.<br /><br />'If you put the sand into the jar first,' &nbsp;He continued,<br />there is no room for &nbsp;the pebbles or the golf balls.<br />The same goes for life.<br /><br />If you spend all your time and energy on the small stuff,<br />You will never have room for the things that are important to you.<br /></span></span></i><i><span style="color: navy;"><br /><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: large;">So...</span></span></i><i><span style="color: navy;"><br /><br /><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: large;">Pay attention to the things that are critical to your happiness.<br />Play With your children.<br />Take time to get medical checkups.<br />Take your partner out to dinner.<br /><br />There will always be time to clean the house and fix the disposal.<br /><br />'Take care of the golf balls first --<br />The things that really matter.<br />Set your priorities. The rest is just sand.'<br /><br />One of the students raised her hand and inquired what the coffee represented.<br /><br />The professor smiled.<br />'I'm glad you asked'.<br /><br />It just goes to show you that no matter how full your life may seem,<br />there's always room for a couple of cups of coffee with a friend.'<br /></span></span></i><span style="color: navy; font-size: x-large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: 24px;"><i><br /></i></span></span><br /></div><div class="blogger-post-footer">Joe's Blog</div>
