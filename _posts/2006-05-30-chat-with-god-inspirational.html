<span style="font-style: italic;"></span><span style="font-weight: bold;">God</span>: Hello. Did you call me?<br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Me</span>: Called you? No.. Who is this?<br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">God</span>: This is GOD. I heard your prayers. So I thought I will chat.<br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Me</span>: I do pray. Just makes me feel good. I am actually busy now. I am in the midst of something.<br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">God</span>: What are you busy at? Ants are busy too.<br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Me</span>: Don't know. But I can't find free time. Life has become hectic. It's rush hour all the time.<br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">God</span>: Sure. Activity gets you busy. But productivity gets you results. Activity consumes time. Productivity frees it.<br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Me</span>: I understand. But I still can't figure out. By the way, I was not expecting YOU to buzz me on instant messaging chat.<br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">God</span>: Well I wanted to resolve your fight for time, by giving you some clarity. In this net era, I wanted to reach you through the medium you are comfortable with.<br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Me:</span> Tell me, why has life become complicated now?<br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">God:</span> Stop analyzing life. Just live it. Analysis is what makes it complicated.<br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Me:</span> Why are we then constantly unhappy?<br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">God:</span> Your today is the tomorrow that you worried about yesterday. You are worrying because you are analyzing. Worrying has become your habit. That's why you are not happy.<br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Me:</span> But how can we not worry when there is so much uncertainty?<br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">God:</span> Uncertainty is inevitable, but worrying is optional.<br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Me:</span> But then, there is so much pain due to uncertainty.<br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">God:</span> Pain is inevitable, but suffering is optional.<br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Me:</span> If suffering is optional, why do good people always suffer?<br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">God: Diamond cannot be polished without friction. Gold cannot be purified without fire. Good people go through trials, but don't suffer. With that experience their life become better not bitter.</span><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Me: </span>You mean to say such experience is useful?<br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">God:</span> Yes. In every term, Experience is a hard teacher. She gives the test first and the lessons afterwards.<br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Me: </span>But still, why should we go through such tests? Why can't we be free from problems?<br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">God:</span> Problems are Purposeful Roadblocks Offering Beneficial Lessons (to) Enhance Mental Strength. Inner strength comes from struggle and endurance, not when you are free from problems.<br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Me:</span> Frankly in the midst of so many problems, we don't know where we are heading.<br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">God:</span> If you look outside you will not know where you are heading. Look inside. Looking outside, you dream. Looking inside, you awaken. Eyes provide sight. Heart provides insight.<br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Me: </span>Sometimes not succeeding fast seems to hurt more than moving in the right direction. What should I do?<br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">God: </span>Success is a measure as decided by others. Satisfaction is a measure as decided by you. Knowing the road ahead is more satisfying than knowing you rode ahead. You work with the compass. Let others work with the clock.<br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Me: </span>In tough times, how do you stay motivated?<br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">God: </span>Always look at how far you have come rather than how far you have to go. Always count your blessing, not what you are missing.<br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Me:</span> What surprises you about people?<br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">God:</span> When they suffer they ask, "why me?" When they prosper, they never ask "Why me?" Everyone wishes to have truth on their side, but few want to be on the side of the truth.<br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Me: </span>Sometimes I ask, who I am, why am I here. I can't get the answer.<br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">God:</span> Seek not to find who you are, but to determine who you want to be. Stop looking for a purpose as to why you are here. Create it. Life is not a process of discovery but a process of creation.<br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Me:</span> How can I get the best out of life?<br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">God:</span> Face your past without regret. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Handle your present with confidence.</span> Prepare for the future without fear.<br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Me: </span>One last question. Sometimes I feel my prayers are not answered.<br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">God:</span> There are no unanswered prayers. At times the answer is NO.<br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Me: </span>Thank you for this wonderful chat. I am so happy to start the New Day with a new sense of inspiration.<br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">God:</span> Well. Keep the faith and drop the fear. Don't believe your doubts and doubt your beliefs. Life is a mystery to solve not a problem to resolve. Trust me. Life is wonderful if you know how to live.<div class="blogger-post-footer">Joe's Blog</div>
