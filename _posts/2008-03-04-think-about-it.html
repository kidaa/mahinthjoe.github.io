<p>Thoughts produce your emotions, which, in turn, result in how you feel about a particular event occurring in your life. It has always amazed me how people can walk around feeling a particular way and not understand that it is their own thoughts,or more accurately what they are telling themselves that is producing the feeling in the first place.</p><br /><p>You are creating your own reality moment by moment, with the thoughts you choose to think and what you say, both to yourself and others. Science can demonstrate that everything in our world is a field of energy and therefore has a particular frequency Recent scientific work has identified particular ranges of frequencies and scientists are able to measure them. Interestingly enough, negative energies, like anger and rage, measure very low on the scale, while positive energies like those given off by prayer and meditation reach the highest measurements.</p><br /><p>At this point you may be wondering what this has to do with your thoughts. Bear with me and I promise to connect the dots. The second part of this equation is the universal law that states <strong>"like attracts like".</strong></p><br /><p>Let us supposing for a moment you are in a bad mood. You are feeling pretty negative. At that particular moment in time your personal vibration, the energy of your thoughts and words is in the lower frequencies. Let us call this particular mood, "Frequency X." Now somewhere off in the distant universe, there is another negative experience. Maybe it is a flat tire, whose frequency happens to be X as well. By virtue the law of attraction, you will begin attracting that or some other undesirable experience to you. Like attracts like, whether we believe it or not.</p><br /><p>The good news is that the <strong>opposite is also true</strong>. If, for example, you are feeling great, taking care to monitor your thoughts, you are now entering a high energy vibration and are in a place to attract other high vibrations, generally things that you want to have. I am sure you have noticed situations when, in a room full of people, one person seems to be the centre of attention. Why do you suppose this is? I will give you a hint, that is it is probably not her perfume.</p><br /><p align="left">Your exercise for the next few days is to closely monitor your every thought and word. When you catch yourself dwelling in the negative, do something to interrupt your pattern and substitute a positive thought in its place. It has been said that any thought consistently held for about 15 to 20 seconds will begin to attract a similar energy This is one of the reasons you want to read your life's vision and goals daily This will hold your attention on thoughts of that which you want and help you bring it towards you.</p><div style="TEXT-ALIGN: right"><em>Jim Donovan</em></div><div class="blogger-post-footer">Joe's Blog</div>
