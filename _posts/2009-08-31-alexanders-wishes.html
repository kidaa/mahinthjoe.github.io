<p>There is very instructive incident involving the life of Alexander, the great Greek king. Alexander, after conquering many kingdoms, was returning home. On the way, he fell ill and it took him to his death bed. With death staring him in his face, Alexander realized how his conquests, his great army, his sharp sword and all his wealth were of no consequence. He now longed to reach home to see his mother's face and bid her his last adieu. But, he had to accept the fact that his sinking health would not permit Him to reach his distant homeland. So, the mighty conqueror lay prostrate and pale, helplessly waiting to breathe his last. He called his generals and said, "<span style="font-weight:bold;">I will depart from this world soon, I have three wishes, please carry them out without fail</span>." With tears flowing down Their cheeks, the generals agreed to abide by their king's last wishes.</P><p>"<span style="font-weight:bold;">My first desire is that</span>," said Alexander, "<span style="font-weight:bold;">My physicians alone must carry my coffin.</span>" After a pause, he continued, "<span style="font-weight:bold;">Secondly, I desire that when my coffin is being carried to the grave, the path leading to the graveyard be strewn with gold, silver and precious stones which I have collected in my treasury.</span>" The king felt exhausted after saying this. He took a minute's rest and continued. "<span style="font-weight:bold;">My third and last wish is that both my hands be kept dangling out of my coffin.</span>" The people who had gathered there wondered at the king's strange wishes. But no one dare bring the question to their lips. Alexander's favorite general kissed his hand and pressed them to his heart. "<span style="font-weight:bold;">O king, we assure you that your wishes will all be fulfilled. But tell us why do you make such strange wishes?</span>"</P><p>At this Alexander took a deep breath and said: "I would like the world to know of the three lessons I have just learnt. I want my physicians to carry my coffin because people should realize that no doctor can really cure any body. They are powerless and cannot save a person from the clutches of death. So let not people take life for granted.</p><p>The second wish of strewing gold, silver and other riches on the way to the graveyard is to tell People that not even a fraction of gold will come with me. I spent all my life earning riches but cannot take anything with me. Let people realize that it is a sheer waste of time to chase wealth.</p><p>And about my third wish of having my hands dangling out of the coffin, I wish people to know that I came empty handed into this world and empty handed I go out of this world." With these words, the king closed his eyes. Soon he let death conquer him and breathed his last.</p><p><br />This is the truth of life <br />khali hath aye the hum kahli hath jayege â€“ (In Hindi)<br />empty handed we come and empty handed we go<br /><br><a href="javascript:window.location = 'http://www.socialmarker.com/?link='+encodeURIComponent (location.href)+'&title='+encodeURIComponent( document.title);"><img src= "http://www.socialmarker.com/bookmark.gif" border="0" alt="share" /></a><noscript><a href="http://www.socialmarker.com">Social Bookmarking</a></noscript><div class="blogger-post-footer">Joe's Blog</div>
