We each have hundreds of habits we unconsciously practice each day.Many of them are helpful, like putting your keys in the same place every day, practicing gratitude when waking up, or having a certain routine for getting ready in the morning. Other habits are ones most people want to change, like overeating, not choosing healthy food, not exercising, or quitting smoking. Even negative thinking is a mental habit you can learn to change. You've heard the expression, "change your thinking, change your life." It's true!<br /><br />1. Identify one habit you want to change. (Hint: Rather than a huge change, like "eating healthy," or "exercising a lot," be specific. Focus on smaller changes that can build one at a time. For example, take a short walk at lunchtime or choose an apple instead of a candy bar for a snack.<br /><br />2. Do you mentally criticize yourself for having a "bad" habit? Stop criticizing right now! Criticizing yourself or feeling guilty actually KEEPS the habit in place. What you resist, persists. Change your thinking. Instead of criticizing, accept yourself with the habit, knowing you want to change it. Patricia learned this tip many years ago when she was trying to quit smoking. She tried so many times and failed! She was angry at herself for not being able to "control" this habit. Finally, she quit trying and just accepted herself as a smoker. A few days later, she quit almost effortlessly. Along theway to changing your habits, if you "slip" a bit, look at yourself in the mirror and tell yourself it's OK. Then back on track.<br /><br />3. Develop awareness about your habit patterns. If you smoke and want to quit, notice what "triggers" you wanting to smoke. If you want to eat less, notice what prompts you to eat, including how you feel. If you want to exercise more, be aware of the excuses you make for why you don't have the time.<br /><br />4. Write down the reasons WHY you want to change the habit. Read them everyday for motivation.<br /><br />5. Use intentions, goals, and affirmations to support the change. An intention sets you in a direction. "I want to quit smoking." The resolutions many people make at the beginning of the year are really intentions for some change. A goal is specific and measurable."I will lose 10 pounds in the next five weeks." An affirmation claims that you have already reached your goal and changes your subconscious mind to fit the new habit. "I am so delighted I am eating healthy and enjoying my new choices so much." All three of these approaches will help you change.<br /><br />6. Keep the decision to change your habit(s) somewhat private if possible. If you've announced you are quitting smoking and then your friends see you still smoking, they might make negative comments. These don't help the change process!<br /><br />7. Write affirmations that support the change you want. For example, if you are changing negative thought patterns, you could affirm, "I easily choose positive thoughts that nourish me." If you are changing eating or exercise habits, write affirmations that enthusiastically claim the new behaviors you want.<br /><br />8. Take some quiet time to write in your journal a good-bye letter to the habit(s) you want to change. Acknowledge how they have served you in some way, and now it's time to let them go.<br /><br />9. Take a few minutes every day to visualize yourself with the new habits.Imagine how you feel, how you look, what your family and friends say to you, etc. By imagining yourself with the new habits, you are creating that reality in your subconscious mind. This technique is very powerful.<br /><br />10. Reward yourself along the way. Look at yourself in the mirror and thank yourself for making the effort to change! Give yourself encouraging words on a daily basis. Buy somethingspecial (within your budget!)<div class="blogger-post-footer">Joe's Blog</div>
