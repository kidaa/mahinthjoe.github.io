<a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/735/1730/1600/GoogleAnalytics.jpg"><img style="FLOAT: left; MARGIN: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; CURSOR: pointer" alt="" src="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/735/1730/320/GoogleAnalytics.jpg" border="0" /></a><br />Hey I am new to this blogosphere and just came across this pretty impressive anlysis tool by Google http://www.google.com/analytics/ I just installed the code over a month back and this is the kind of report I got for over a month of blogging.<br />My Yahoo360 blogs I recieve a page view count and visitors and YahooBlog friends can comment but in this blog you can even leave anonymous comments. I am pretty surprised as I saw no comments so I guessed I was virtually unknown never knew I was so popular, thanks blogger friends. Another beautiful feature of this www.blogger.com is that it lets you partner in these blogs, that is instead of one person managing a blog we can form a group of members who can post inspirational articles to a common blog. Anyone who is intrested in becoming a part of this blog is welcome, create an account and please contact me and I will try out my first partnership.<br /><object height="355" width="425"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/rHeKRvo6OhI&amp;rel=1"><param name="wmode" value="transparent"><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/rHeKRvo6OhI&rel=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" wmode="transparent" width="425" height="355"></embed></object><div class="blogger-post-footer">Joe's Blog</div>
