<span style="font-size:85%;">Action Item 1: </span><strong><span style="font-size:85%;">Be optimistic. </span></strong><br /><span style="font-size:85%;">When you look into the future and see things that you want and that you look forward to having, or when you look into the future and see light and positively, you give off a vibe that is very positive. People want to be around a person who is heading toward good things. When you feel optimistic about what is to come, so do others around you. And they feel optimistic about being around you. </span><br /><span style="font-size:85%;">Most people find sarcasm and pessimism draining to be around after a while. If you're inclined towards that way of thinking, it's not always so easy to just try and stop it. Sometimes a bitter outlook is a defense; a precursor of depression. Don't take this lightly, and don't ignore it. If you think you might be depressed and increasing your attractiveness is a motivator for you to seek help, that's great. But remember that your health and your future are much more important than landing a date. </span><br /><span style="font-size:85%;">Action Item 2: </span><strong><span style="font-size:85%;">Believe in people. </span></strong><br /><span style="font-size:85%;">Of course people can't read your mind, but what you are thinking can affect the vibe you give off. Believe it or not, people are incredibly sensitive to not being trusted. Why should they trust you if you don't trust them? Besides, if you start off a relationship with a worst-case scenario in mind, you're more than likely setting yourself up for the catastrophe you fear. Sometimes empathy - seeing things from another person's perspective - and a leap of faith is needed. </span><br /><span style="font-size:85%;">Keep in mind that if you find it difficult or impossible to believe in people in general, you might have some other, more serious issues to grapple with before you can even starting to address or improve your vibe. </span><br /><span style="font-size:85%;">Action Item 3: </span><strong><span style="font-size:85%;">Get comfortable. </span></strong><br /><span style="font-size:85%;">No matter how much stress life is dishing you, what people pick up on is how well, or not well, you deal with it. If you react by getting tense, impatient or irritable, you aren't going to attract people to you. Stress has negative effects on your health as well, as it can affect the health of your skin and eating habits — and therefore your physical attractiveness. </span><br /><span style="font-size:85%;">So how do you get calmer, get more comfortable in your own skin? Take stock of your life in general and your history of making changes in order to avoid stress. If it's hard for you to talk to others about what's bothering you, it might be worth it to work a little on that. Sometimes reducing stress can be as simple as changing an external situation that is causing you to feel stressed. </span><br /><span style="font-size:85%;">If you have a lot of external stress coming at you, try meditating or practicing yoga. Taking the time to sit calmly, in silence, and noticing how you feel can do a lot toward dissipating stress. Going for walks, remembering to breathe — these can relieve pent-up stress. By identifying what's not working in your life and changing it, you can empower yourself. Before making any big changes, you may want to make sure that the stress is not coming from inside of you — in that case, all the external changes in the world won't do the trick.</span><div class="blogger-post-footer">Joe's Blog</div>
