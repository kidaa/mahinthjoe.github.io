You get ranked ahead or behind others in regard to your competence in retaining information. You stroll with this intelligence in and out of fields of knowledge, getting always more marks on your preserving tablets. </p><p align="left">There is another kind of tablet, one already completed and preserved inside you. A spring overflowing its springbox. A freshness in the center of the chest. This other intelligence does not turn yellow or stagnate. It’s fluid, and it doesn’t move from outside to inside through the conduits of plumbing-learning. </p><p align="left">This second knowing is a fountainhead from within you, moving out. </p><p align="right">The Essesential Rumi , Translation by Coleman Barks with John Moyne.<br />Harper, San Francisco, 1995.</p><p align="left"><br /><strong>The Wind, One Brilliant Day</strong><br />The wind, one brilliant day, called to my soul with an odor of jasmine.<br />“In return for the odor of my jasmine, I’d like all the odor of your roses.”<br />“I have no roses; all the flowers in my garden are dead.”<br />“Well then, I’ll take the withered petals and the yellow leaves and the waters of the fountain.”<br />The wind left. And I wept. And I said to myself:<br />“What have you done with the garden that was entrusted to you?”</p><p align="right">Antonio Machado<br />Translated by Robert Bly</p><br /><strong>I am not I</strong><br /><p align="left">I am this one<br />Walking beside me whom I do not see,<br />Whom at times I manage to visit,<br />And whom at other times I forget;<br />The one who remains silent when I talk,<br />The one who forgives, sweet, when I hate,<br />The one who takes a walk where I am not,<br />The one who will remain standing when I die.</p><p align="right">Juan Ramon Jimenez<br />Translated by Robert Bly</p><p align="left"><br />We have no reason to harbor any mistrust against our world, for it is not against us. If it has terrors, they are our terrors. If it has abysses, these abysses belong to us. If there are dangers, we must try to love them, and only if we could arrange our lives in accordance with the principle that tells us that we must always trust in the difficult, then what now appears to us to<br />be alien will become our most intimate and trusted experience. How could we forget those ancient myths that stand at the beginning of all races--the myths about dragons that at the last moment are transformed into princesses. Perhaps all the dragons in our lives are only princesses waiting for us to act, just once, with beauty and courage. Perhaps everything that frightens us is, in its deepest essence, something helpless that wants our love.</p><p align="left">So you must not be frightened if a sadness rises before you larger than any you’ve ever seen, if an anxiety like light and cloud shadows moves over your hands and everything that you do. You must realize that something has happened to you. Life has not forgotten you, that it holds you in its hands and will not let you fall. Why do you want to shut out of your life any uneasiness, any miseries, or any depressions? For after all, you do not know what work these conditions are doing inside you. </p><p align="right">Rainer Maria Rilke<br /></p><p align="left">Mind-Body Medicine: Jon Kabat-Zinn, Ph.D. and Saki Santorelli, Ed.D.</p><p align="left">Joe Satriani plays <strong>Made of tears</strong> Live 2006<br /></p><div class="blogger-post-footer">Joe's Blog</div>
