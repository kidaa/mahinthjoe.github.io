I learned it under the grand laws of nature, <strong>the mind can hold only one thought at any one time</strong>. Try it yourself, you will see that it is true.<br /><br />Using this little known information, any one can create a positive, creative mindset within a short period. The process is straight forward: when an undesirable thought occuppies the focal point of your mind, immidiately replace it with a uplifting one. It's as if your mind is a giant side projector, with every thought in your mind being a slide. Whenever a negative slide comes up on the screen, take swift action to replace it with a positive one.<br /><br /><div style="TEXT-ALIGN: center"><strong>Self-knowledge is the stepping stone to self mastery.<br /><br /></strong><span style="font-size:100%;">"Thoughts are vital, living things, little bundles of energy, if you will. Most people dont give a any though to the nature of their thoughts and yet, the quality of your thinking determines the quality of your life. <strong>Thoughts are as much a part of the material world as the lake you swim in or the streets you walk on."</strong></span><br /><br /><span style="font-size:100%;">If you want to live life to the fullest, care for your thoughts as you would your most prized possession. </span></div><div class="blogger-post-footer">Joe's Blog</div>
