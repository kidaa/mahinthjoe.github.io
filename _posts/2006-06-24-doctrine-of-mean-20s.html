It matters not what you try to think out, but when you once try to think out you must never give up until you have got what you want.It matters not what you try to sift out, but when you once try to sift out you mmust never give it up until you have sifted it out clearly & distinctly.It matters not what you try to carry out, but when you once try to carry out a thing you must never give it up until you you have done it thoroughly and well. If another man succeeds by one effort, you will use a hundred efforts. If another man succeeds by ten efforts, you will use a thousand  efforts.Let a man really succeed in this manner, and though dull, he will surely become intelligent; though weak, he will surely become strong.&nbsp;<a href='http://picasa.google.com/blogger/' target='ext'><img src='http://photos1.blogger.com/pbp.gif' alt='Posted by Picasa' style='border: 0px none ; padding: 0px; background: transparent none repeat scroll 0% 50%; -moz-background-clip: initial; -moz-background-origin: initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: initial;' align='middle' border='0' /></a> <div class="blogger-post-footer">Joe's Blog</div>
