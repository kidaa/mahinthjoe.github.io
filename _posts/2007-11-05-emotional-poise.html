At every moment we have a dozen different things to do, a dozen problems to solve, a dozen strains to endure. We see ourselves as overdriven, overburdened, overtired. This is a common mental picture and it is totally false. </em>No one of us, however crowded his life, has such an existence. <strong>What is the true picture of your life? </strong><br />Imagine that there is an hour glass on your desk. Connecting the bowl at the top with the bowl at the bottom is a tube so thin that only one grain of sand can pass through it at a time. That is the true picture of your life, even on a super busy day, The crowded hours come to you always one moment at a time. That is the only way they can come. The day may bring many tasks, many problems, strains, but invariably they come in single file. You want to gain emotional poise?<br />Remember the hourglass, the grains of sand dropping one by one.<div class="blogger-post-footer">Joe's Blog</div>
