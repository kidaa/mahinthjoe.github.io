I see stars, both celestial and terrestrial. I meet them at airports, in city lounges,in corporate do's and in the field of sports. I meet them on earth and in the heavens. You know, the strange thing is that stars are very ordinary people like you and I. They take birth, flicker for a while and fade away just as all of us do. The only difference is that stars shine a little longer in our minds, and shine a little more brightly than most of us.<br /><br />I met this space scientist who told me that many stars that twinkle in the sky today, no longer exist in reality. Like our old planet Pluto they have been dwarfed today. But, the light that comes from them travels and remains long after the stars are gone. The stars have twinkled, wrinkled and have vanished, even as we see them. We continue to see them because their light still travels and flickers in our eyes. This is also our terrestrial star story. They are bom, they blow their horn and then, they are gone! Some of us hang their pictures, and some share fireside stories about their secret sex lives!<br /><br />Next time you meet a star, do not feel small. Remember, the star shines in the retina of your eyes and the star lives in your heart. The star measures his success by the attention you give him. Without your attention, the star has no value. <strong>If you haven't got me already, just know this to be true: you may not yet be a star but YOU certainly are the light that shines through every star!<br /></strong><br /><br /><br /><div align="right">The author <a href="http://www.debchat.com/index.php">Dr.Debashis Chatterjee </a>is a Professor at IIM, Lucknow. </div><br /><div align="right">Other <a href="http://www.debchat.com/phpfiles/archives_index.php">Success Sutras</a></div><br /><div align="right"><br />Arthur Miller:-"<strong>The need of man to wholly realize himself is the only fixed star</strong>."</div></div><div class="blogger-post-footer">Joe's Blog</div>
