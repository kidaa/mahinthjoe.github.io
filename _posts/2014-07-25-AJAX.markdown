<h1>Traditional vs Asynchronous Interaction</h1>
<p>Based on Ajax in Action by Crane and Pascarllo/’s four Principles of AJAX p.18-19</p>
<ul>
<li>Browser Hosts an application not Content</li>
<li>The server delivers data, not content.</li>
<li>User interaction with the application can be fluid and continuous.</li>
<li>This is real coding and requires discipline.</li>
</ul>
-p.17-23 The AJAX model Pic p.33
Typical AJAX control flow
<ol>
<li>XMLHttpRequest object (or similar) instantiated by client application</li>
<li>Object is used to send and recieve data to the web server.</li>
<li>If request is asynchronous, other processing is done</li>
<li>When a response from server is received, it is examined.</li>
<li>A callback handler assigned to the object processes responses.</li>
<li>Server sends responses at various stages in its processing, so what we have received may be an ’status update’ but not actual response.</li>
<li>When response payload is  finally received, it is acted upon in the client application.</li>
<li>AJAX interaction can vary depending on the browser platform.</li>
</ol>
