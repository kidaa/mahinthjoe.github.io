Once when we were sitting at the edge of a swimming pool, she filled the palm of her hand with some water and held it before me, and said this:"You see this water carefully contained on my hand? <strong>It symbolizes Love</strong>."<br /><br />This was how I saw it: As long as you keep your hand caringly open and allow it to remain there, it will always be there. However, if you attempt to close your fingers round it and try to posses it, it will spill through the first cracks it finds.<br /><br />This is the greatest mistake that people do when they meet love...they try to posses it, they demand, they expect... and just like the water spilling out of your hand, love will retrieve from you . For love is meant to be free, you cannot change its nature. If there are people you love, allow them to be free beings.<br /><br /><div align="center">Give and don't expect.</div><div align="center">Advise, but don't order.</div><div align="center">Ask, but never demand.</div><div align="left"></div><br /><div align="left">It might sound simple, but it is a lesson that may take a lifetime to truly practice. It is the secret to true love. To truly practice it, you must sincerely feel no expectations from those who you love, and yet an unconditional caring."Passing thought... Life is not measured by the number of breaths we take; but by the moments that take our breath away.....<br /><br /></div><a href="http://philip9876.files.wordpress.com/2007/10/first-love.jpeg"><img style="FLOAT: right; MARGIN: 0px 0px 10px 10px; WIDTH: 320px; CURSOR: hand" alt="" src="http://philip9876.files.wordpress.com/2007/10/first-love.jpeg" border="0" /></a><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><div align="left"><strong>Life is beautiful!!!
