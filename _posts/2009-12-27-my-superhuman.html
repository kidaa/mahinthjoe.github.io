<div style="text-align: center;">“When you start out in a team, you have to get the teamwork going and then you get something back.” <span style="font-size: x-large;">Michael Schumacher</span><br /></div><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_Z0_Yj69ls8Q/SzeXn3FQAyI/AAAAAAAAEGA/4EQEe1txC2o/s1600-h/11schumacher.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; cssfloat: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" ps="true" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_Z0_Yj69ls8Q/SzeXn3FQAyI/AAAAAAAAEGA/4EQEe1txC2o/s320/11schumacher.jpg" /></a><span style="color: blue; font-size: large;">ONE&nbsp;&amp; ONLY</span><br /></div>For nearly a decade of his 16 years in Formula One, he ruled like a monarch. Save for his initial years at Jordan, Michael Schumacher instilled fear in the minds of his rivals with his driving skills which swung wildly between genius and manic. While he transformed himself into a fierce competitor during his stay at Benneton for whom he won the driver's title twice, he matured into a world beater at Ferrari.<br /><br />But he was so superior to others in the second half of his career that F1 became completely lopsided with Schumacher winning 91 Grand Prix titles in 250 starts. His ultimate stamp on Formula One was his feat of winning five titles in row from 2000 to 2004.<br /><br />The champion had another side to his personality which appeals to the world: his philanthropic activities. For instance, he spontaneously donated $10 billion to the tsunami victims in 2005!<br /><a href="javascript:window.location = 'http://www.socialmarker.com/?link='+encodeURIComponent (location.href)+'&amp;title='+encodeURIComponent( document.title);"><img alt="share" border="0" src="http://www.socialmarker.com/bookmark.gif" /></a><noscript></noscript><div class="blogger-post-footer">Joe's Blog</div>
