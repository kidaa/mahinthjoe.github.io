Got an forward and it kinda made sence so blogging it<br /><br />There could be 500 apples at a time on an apple tree and each apple has ten seeds. "Why would you need so many seeds to grow just a few more apple trees?" Well because not all seeds become trees. Most seeds never grow So you want to make something happen, you should try more than once.<br /><br />You might have to attend 20 interviews to get one job. Or interview 40 candidates to find one good employee. Or talk to 50 people before seling one house, car or one idea. Or meet more than a hundred people before you make that <span style="font-weight: bold;">special friend</span>.<br /><br />When we understand the "The Law Of The Seed" we stop feeling like victims. We just need to understand the laws of the nature and work with them.<br /><br />Don't decide how you think the world <span style="font-weight: bold;">SHOULD </span>be or how everyone <span style="font-weight: bold;">SHOULD </span>behave. Then when the world doesn't obey your rules, <span style="font-weight: bold;">you get angry!</span> Learn to demand less instead, have preferences!<br /><br />Its not the problem that is the issue. Rather it is your attitude that is the problem. It's not what happens to you that determines your happiness. It's how you think about what happens to you!<div class="blogger-post-footer">Joe's Blog</div>
