More than 100 years ago, author Robert Louis Stevenson offered the following tips for maintaining a positive attitude. They still apply today<br /><br />Make up your mind to be happy. <br />Learn to find pleasure in simple things.<br />Make the best of your circumstances. Everyone has problems. The trick is to make laughter outweigh the tears.<br />Don’t take yourself too seriously. <br />Don’t think that somehow you should be protected from misfortunes that befall others.<br />You can’t please everybody. Don’t let criticism worry you.<br />Don’t let your anybody set your standards. Be yourself.<br />Do the things you enjoy doing, but stay out of debt.<br />Don’t borrow trouble. Imaginary burdens are harder to bear than the actual ones.<br /><br />Hate poisons the soul, so don’t carry grudges. Avoid people who make you unhappy.<br />Have many interests. If you can’t travel, read about new places.<br />Don’t hold post-mortems. <br />Don’t spend your life brooding over sorrows and mistakes.<br />Do what you can for those less fortunate than yourself.<br /><br />Keep busy at something. A busy person never has time to be unhappy.<br /><a href="javascript:window.location = 'http://www.socialmarker.com/?link='+encodeURIComponent (location.href)+'&title='+encodeURIComponent( document.title);"><img src= "http://www.socialmarker.com/bookmark.gif" border="0" alt="share" /></a><noscript><a href="http://www.socialmarker.com">Social Bookmarking</a></noscript><div class="blogger-post-footer">Joe's Blog</div>
