This clearly required surgery, and so I can rightly claim that mine is the oldest profession in the world." The civil engineer interrupted, and said, "But even earlier in the book of Genesis, it states that God created the order of the heavens and the<strong> </strong>earth from out of the chaos. This was the first and certainly the most spectacular application of-civil engineering. Therefore, fair doctor, you are wrong: mine is the oldest profession in the world." The computer scientist leaned back in her chair, smiled, and then said confidently, <strong>"Ah, but who do you think created the chaos?"</strong></div><br /><br /><br /><div align="right"><br /><em>That explains a lot I guess from Object Oriented Analysis &amp; Design by GRADY BOOCH.<br /></div></em><div class="blogger-post-footer">Joe's Blog</div>
