<div align="left"><span style="font-family:Comic Sans MS;color:#646060;">There was a little boy visiting his grandparents on their farm. He was given a slingshot to play with out in the woods.He Practiced in the woods, but he could never hit the target. Getting A little discouraged, he headed back for dinner. As he was Walking back he saw Grandma's pet duck. <br />Just out of impulse, he let the slingshot fly, hit the duck Square in the head, and killed it. He was shocked and grieved.<br />In a panic, he hid the dead duck in the wood pile, only to see His sister watching! Sally had seen it all, but she said nothing. <br /><br />After lunch the next day Grandma said, "</span><a href="javascript:ol('http://www.funlok.com/modules.php?name%3dNews%26amp;file%3darticle%26amp;sid%3d943');"><span style="font-family:Comic Sans MS;color:#ff8040;">  Sally, let's wash the Dishes</span></a><span style="font-family:Comic Sans MS;color:#646060;">."<br />But Sally said, "</span><a href="javascript:ol('http://www.funlok.com/modules.php?name%3dNews%26amp;file%3darticle%26amp;sid%3d943');">  <span style="font-family:Comic Sans MS;color:#646060;"><span style="color:#ff8040;">Grandma, Johnny told me he wanted to help in The kitchen</span>." Then she whispered to him, "<span style="color:#ff8040;">Remember the duck</span></span>  </a><span style="font-family:Comic Sans MS;color:#646060;">?" So Johnny did the dishes.<br /><br />Later that day, Grandpa asked if the children wanted to go Fishing and Grandma said, "</span><a href="javascript:ol('http://www.funlok.com/modules.php?name%3dNews%26amp;file%3darticle%26amp;sid%3d943');">  <span style="font-family:Comic Sans MS;color:#ff8040;">I'm sorry but I need Sally to help make Supper</span></a><span style="font-family:Comic Sans MS;color:#646060;"><span style="color:#ff8040;">.</span>"  Sally just smiled and said," </span> <a href="javascript:ol('http://www.funlok.com/modules.php?name%3dNews%26amp;file%3darticle%26amp;sid%3d943');"><span style="font-family:Comic Sans MS;color:#ff8040;">Well that's all right because Johnny told  Me he wanted to help</span></a><span style="font-family:Comic Sans MS;color:#646060;">." She whispered again, "</span><a href="javascript:ol('http://www.funlok.com/modules.php?name%3dNews%26amp;file%3darticle%26amp;sid%3d943');">  <span style="font-family:Comic Sans MS;color:#ff8040;">Remember the duck</span></a><span style="font-family:Comic Sans MS;color:#646060;">?" So Sally Went fishing and Johnny stayed to help. <br /><br />After several days of Johnny doing both his chores and Sally's He finally couldn't stand it any longer.  He came to Grandma and confessed that he had killed the duck.  Grandma knelt down, gave him a hug, and said, "</span><a href="javascript:ol('http://www.funlok.com/modules.php?name%3dNews%26amp;file%3darticle%26amp;sid%3d943');"> <span style="font-family:Comic Sans MS;color:#ff8040;"> Sweetheart, I know.
