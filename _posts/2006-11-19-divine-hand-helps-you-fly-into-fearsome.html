The mother eagle tried hard to induce the little one to leave the nest, but the baby was afraid. "I held my breath, for I knew what was comming" recounts cristable Gladwell.<br /><br />The Little fellow stood on the edje of the nest, looking down at the plunge which he dared not to take. There was a sharp cry from behind which made him alert, tense as a watch spring. The next instant the mother eagle had swooped , striking the nest at his feet, sending the support of twigs and himself with them and into the air."He was now afloat now, afloat on the blue air despite himself, and he flapped lustily for life. Over him, under him & beside him hovered the mother on tireless wings, calling softly that she was there. But the awful fear of the depths and the lance tops of the spruces was upon the little one; his flapping grew wilder; he fell faster and faster. Suddenly more in fright because he had lost his strength - he had lost his balance and tipped head downward in the air. It was all over; he folded his wings to be dashed into pieces among the trees. Then like a flash the mother eagle shot under him, his despairing feet touched her broad shoulders, between her wings. He righted himself, rested an instant, found his head; then she dropped like a shot from under him to come down with his own wings.<br /><br />"It was all the work of an instant before I lost them among the trees far below.And when I found them again with my glass, the eaglet was on top of a great pine and the mother was feeding him."<br /><br />Cristable's story of the mother eagle first pushing her little one to fly, then protecting the eaglet till it righted itself and then once again leaving it free could be very similar to the relationship we have with god and the way we live life.<br /><strong></strong><br /><strong>Life has a way of challenging us and pushing us to the edge,</strong> when our fears could get the better of us and we rerfuse to move either forward or upward. All the while we feel threatned alone and fearful. God like mother eagle hovers over us, protecting us on all sides. And suddenly the nest is knocked from under our feet and we are left to negotiate the air and the winds alone.<br /><br />When it seems we would have a free fall and dash ourselves to death suddenly the protective hand wether family friends or compassionate strangers covers us and we are able to right ourselves again.Repeatedly we are thrust into the unknown the uncharted and the uncertain. And like the eaglet we are afraid to encounter what is really the human predicament. Just as we are pushed into an uncertain world, just as we develope cold feet and fall from fear and fright, God hovers over us and protects us.<br /><br />Sometimes our sence of timing could be all wrong. We may have set plans and belive that we could chart our future. Sometimes our sence of timing could agree with God's and other times, not. But like the mother eagle, God is in control.<br /><br />At times we believe that we can no longer handle the uncertainity. We cling to the familiar but the only constant in life is change. Then as the eagle and the eaglet that learns to fly, we have to trust in the larger scheme of life and the universe, t believe that we have it in us to meet overcome all that has to be overcome and we rest in the palm of God's hand. We may yet flounder, but God's protective hand will bear us up and enable us to walk and fly.<br /><br /><a href="http://spirituality.indiatimes.com">http://spirituality.indiatimes.com</a><br />Author Janina Gomes in The Speaking Tree, Times Of India 18th Nov 2006<div class="blogger-post-footer">Joe's Blog</div>
