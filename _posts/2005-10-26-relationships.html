<strong><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:130%;">Relationships</span></strong><br /><span style="font-size:85%;">The extent to which you are positively affected by the people in your life who make up your social support network is what is relationship. </span><span style="font-size:85%;">Social interaction is a basic human need, and its benefits are numerous. No matter how independent you feel you are, humans actually require a certain amount of social interaction in order to thrive. The amount and variety of social interaction each person needs to be at their peak happiness levels will vary. Regardless of what you find your specific needs to be, below you'll find three ideas to help you tend and grow your connections with others. </span><br /><ol><li><strong><span style="font-size:85%;">Give priority to your closest relationships. </span></strong><span style="font-size:85%;">Make a list of the two to five people you regard as your closest confidants. When you have a choice to make between spending time with these close friends that you've listed or hanging out with someone else, choose those close friends first. Also, try keeping in touch with all of your close friends on a more regular basis. Show each one of them that you value the connection the two of you share.</span></li><br /><li><strong><span style="font-size:85%;">Throw a party</span></strong><span style="font-size:85%;">. Invite everyone you know or would like to know better and encourage your friends to bring guests that you don't know. This way, you'll have the opportunity to expand your network of friends and acquaintances easily and quickly. This tactic can work even better if you invite a slightly smaller core group of people for a monthly get together. Festivities could take the form of a potluck dinner, a book club, a movie night, or even a bowling party.</span></li><br /><li><strong><span style="font-size:85%;">Help others. </span></strong><span style="font-size:85%;">Your support network also provides you with the opportunity to support others when they need it. Giving help to a friend makes you feel needed, brings you closer to your friend, and generally makes you feel better about yourself.</span></li></ol><span style="font-size:85%;"><a href="http://mahinth.blogspot.com/2008/03/relationships.html">Click for More on Relationship</a></span><div class="blogger-post-footer">Joe's Blog</div>
