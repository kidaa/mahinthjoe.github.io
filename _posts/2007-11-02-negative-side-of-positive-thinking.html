<div align="justify">Thoughts are neither negative nor positive. <strong>Thoughts just are</strong>. What they turn out to be, depends on the context. Given a context, thoughts can be realistic or unrealistic; mean or generous; selfish or selfless. Many chronic positive thinkers insist that the glass is half full — do they still remain positive when the glass is half full of polluted water? A positive thinking fellow is like someone who decides that it is more honourable to fall down from the Eiffel Tower rather than from a ten-storied building! It doesn't matter where you fall from, the consequence will be disastrous. In reality, no positive thought can arise without a negative thought hiding around it. They are like the two poles of a magnet. For instance, <strong>if I ask you not to think of Mallika Sherawat for the next one minute — you will invariably think of her. Just try it!</strong></div><div align="justify"> </div><div align="justify"></div><div align="justify"><strong>Positive thinking can turn negative very quickly. Why? Because they originate in the same source.</strong> They are interconnected like marigold and manure. It takes a blooming marigold just a few days to become manure. Similarly, manure becomes a flower in the course of time. Marigold and manure are two expressions of one shared identity. Negative thinking comes from the same shared space as positive thinking. I am not endorsing negative thinking. I am simply saying, thoughts become positive or negative depending on you. It is you who sets the standards and values by which you evaluate thoughts. A lot of people talk about falling standards of every thing: food, music, newspapers, movies, the young generation or whatever. </div><div align="justify"></div><strong></strong><div align="justify"><strong>Actually standards have neither fallen nor risen. Standards have just shifted; your value frames have changed.</strong><br /></div><div align="right"><a href="http://www.debchat.com/"><em>Dr.Debashis Chatterjee</em></a><em> is a Professor at IIM, Lucknow</em></div><div class="blogger-post-footer">Joe's Blog</div>
