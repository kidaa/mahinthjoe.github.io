<span style="font-size: 10pt;">  Although the difference between December 31st and January 1st is only one day, our psyche measures it as a major milestone in our existence.   </span><span style="font-size: 10pt;">It is good to have a fresh start on January 1st. This gives us the needed motivation to release our previous beliefs and behaviours. The energy of a new year is very reassuring and helps us 'turn the page' on what we no longer desire. <br /><br /></span>  <span style="font-size: 10pt;">Just as businesses take inventory at the beginning or end of a year, so, too, can we. When we take out time to do an inventory of our life, we reconnect with who and what we are.   </span><span style="font-size: 10pt;">By reflecting this way, it helps us to rediscover our life's goals and aspirations. When you look at your goals and dreams, are you on track? Are you meeting the goals you set?   </span><span style="font-size: 10pt;">For example, you may have a goal of being healthy and dynamic — yet, in practice, you primarily watch TV and munch on fried and oily potato chips. There appears to be a dichotomy between desire and practice.   </span><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Taking an impartial look at our lives can be very useful. I ask you not to judge or criticise yourself — simply observe. This year, I am focussing on attaining peace  both within myself and with others around me.  </span><br /> <span style="font-size: 10pt;"><br />Remember, we are the creators of the reality around us. By focussing on peace, first within ourselves, next with everyone we meet, be it the family, friends, or people on the street, the world will begin resonating to the same frequency.</span><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> Additionally, we need to make peace with the statesmen/women of this planet. If we spend time bemoaning the state of the world, criticising the behaviour of our politicians, and becoming angry at the defilement of Mother Earth, we cannot be at peace.  </span><br /> <span style="font-size: 10pt;">Of major importance is the fact that we are not contributing to the solution. Our angry thoughts simply add fuel to the fire! By saying this, I do not mean to suggest we bow down and allow things to continue as they are.  </span><br /> <span style="font-size: 10pt;">No. We need to take the necessary steps to redirect the leadership on this planet, but we must do it from an inner state of peace. We must participate and make change.  </span><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> <br /><br />We must understand that everyone has been doing what they felt they needed to do. It is the way of the peaceful warrior. We do not lay down and let others trod over us and damage our beloved planet and its inhabitants.</span> <span style="font-size: 10pt;">Neither do we participate in the game of violence and arrogance. If we adopt the same behaviour as the aggressors, we have become one of them. We should constantly question our motives and direction.   </span><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Are we moving towards harmony and peace for all? Are we focussing on wanting a resolution where everyone's highest good is being considered? We must focus on peaceful resolutions, always looking for the highest path, the path of love and where the highest good of all emerges a winner.  </span><br /> <span style="font-size: 10pt;">Living and working with others can be a very enlightening experience when we realise that everyone is us — at some stage of our evolution.   </span><span style="font-size: 10pt;">The person we admire may be where we are headed, whereas, the one we judge and criticise may be where we are, or where we have been — or perhaps they are portraying someone from our past and we get to relive similar situations and interactions so that we can heal our own behaviour. <br /></span><span style="font-size: 10pt;">  The lesson is to learn to heal — to deal with all situations in peace and objectivity, always looking for the highest good for all concerned. It's a new year. It's a new day. It's a new moment.   </span><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Every moment is another opportunity to raise our vibrations and thus contribute to raising the vibration of the planet and all of its inhabitants.   </span><span style="font-size: 10pt;">As every one of us renounces fear and resentments, we are helping others up another step in the ladder of life. We are not separate. Our actions, thoughts, and desires resonate in the universe to be picked up by others.   </span><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Now is the time to make sure that we contribute to the upliftment of humanity. We are all in this together. Let's join forces (the forces of love and peace) and create a better world. We are the leaders of the transition.   </span><span style="font-size: 10pt;">We can make a difference by our individual actions, thoughts, and visions, and by our collective actions, thoughts, and visions.   </span><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Love is the key, and you are the gatekeeper who holds it — love for ourselves, for our neighbours, for those better off or worse off than us.   </span><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Open the door of heart and let the light & love shine to yourself, to others, and through you and all. Happy New Year!</span><br /><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><br /></span><div class="blogger-post-footer">Joe's Blog</div>
