I have a full life."<br />The American interrupted, "I have an MBA from Harvard, and I can help you! </span></span><span style="font-family:Bookman Old Style;"><span style="font-family:'Bookman Old Style';"></span></span><span style="font-family:Bookman Old Style;"><span style="font-family:'Bookman Old Style';">You should start by fishing longer every day. You can then sell the extra fish you catch. </span></span><span style="font-family:Bookman Old Style;"><span style="font-family:'Bookman Old Style';"></span></span><span style="font-family:Bookman Old Style;"><span style="font-family:'Bookman Old Style';">With the extra revenue, you can buy a bigger boat."<br />"And after that?" asked the Mexican.<br />"With the extra money the larger boat will bring, you can buy a second one and a third one and so on until you have an entire fleet of trawlers. Instead of selling your fish to a middle man, you can then negotiate directly with the processing plants and maybe even open your own plant.<br />You can then leave this little village and move to Mexico City, Los Angeles, or even New York City! From there you can direct your huge new enterprise."<br />"How long would that take?" asked the Mexican.<br />"Twenty, perhaps twenty-five years," replied the American.<br />"And after that?"<br />"Afterwards? Well my Friend, That's when it gets really interesting," answered the American, laughing. "When your business gets really big, you can start selling stocks and make millions!"<br />"Millions? Really? And after that?" said the Mexican.<br />"After that you'll be able to retire, live in a tiny village near the coast, sleep late, play with your children, catch a few fish, take a siesta with your wife and spend your evenings doing what you like and enjoying your friends."</span></span><span style="font-family:Bookman Old Style;"><span style="font-family:'Bookman Old Style';"><br /></span></span><span style="font-family:Bookman Old Style;"><span style="font-family:'Bookman Old Style';"><strong>"that what exactly am doing now." said the Mexican</strong></span></span><span style="font-family:Bookman Old Style;"><span style="font-family:'Bookman Old Style';"><br />And the moral is:<br />Know where you're going in life...<br />you may already be there </span></span></tt></div><div class="blogger-post-footer">Joe's Blog</div>
