You name them work, family, Health, friends & spirit &amp; you are keeping all of these in the air. You will soon understand that work is a rubber ball. If you drop it it will bounce back. But all the other 4 balls family, Health, friends &amp; spirit are made of glass. If you drop one of these, they will be irrevocably scuffed or damaged or even shattered and they will never be the same. You must understand that and strive for balance in your life.<div class="blogger-post-footer">Joe's Blog</div>
