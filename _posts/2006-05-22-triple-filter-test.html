In ancient Greece (469 - 399 BC), Socrates was widely lauded for his wisdom.<br />One day the great philosopher came upon an acquaintance who ran up to him excitedly and    said, "<span style="font-weight: bold;">Socrates, do you know what I just heard about one of your students</span>?"<br />Wait a moment," Socrates replied. "Before you tell me I'd like you to pass a little test.<br />It's called the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Triple Filter Test.</span>"<br />"Triple filter?"<br />"That's right," Socrates continued. "Before you talk to me about my student let's take a moment to filter what you're going to say. <span style="font-weight: bold;">The first filter is Truth.</span> Have you made absolutely sure that what you are about to tell me is true?"<br />"No," the man said, "actually I just heard about it and..."<br />"All right," said Socrates. "So you don't really know if it's true or not. Now let's try the second filter, the filter of Goodness. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Is</span> what you are about to tell me about my student <span style="font-weight: bold;">something</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">good?</span>"<br />"No, on the contrary..."<br />"So," Socrates continued, "you want to tell me something bad about him, even though you're not certain it's true?"<br />The man shrugged, a little embarrassed.<br />Socrates continued. "You may still pass the test though, because there is a third filter - the filter of Usefulness. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Is </span>what you want to tell me about my student <span style="font-weight: bold;">going to be useful to me</span>?"<br />"No, not really..."<br />"Well," concluded Socrates, "if what you want to tell me is neither True nor Good nor even Useful, why tell it to me at all?"<br /><br />This is the reason Socrates was a great philosopher and held in such high esteem.<br />Bible Says, <span style="font-weight: bold;">" It is the same with our tongue. It is a small part of the body, but it can boast about doing great things.A big forest fire can be started with only a little flame. The tongue is like a fire. It is a world of evil among the parts of our body. It spreads its evil through our whole body and starts a fire that influences all of life. It gets this fire from hell."
