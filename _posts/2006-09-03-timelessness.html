What sights have we seen that fail to catch the eye?<br />What songs heard that ears cannot catch?<br />What unmeasured distances we have traversed?<br />What sins gone through, not encountered in Eden?<br />What pains unknown before have we taken on?<br />We have conceded let them be whatever they are. Now that we have learnt life is not meant To be spent on reflections over past sorrows, Please, go on playing non stop the santoori, Until the dawn arrives that brings joy. Until Zorba sings on the shores of twilight...<br /><div style="text-align: right;">Ayyapa Paniker<br /></div><div class="blogger-post-footer">Joe's Blog</div>
