<p>"This simple word carries a depth of meaning. The word I am speaking of is PASSION, and it is a word you must constantly keep at the forefront of your mind as you follow your mission and attain your goals.<span style="font-weight:bold;">A burning sense of passion is the most potent fuel for your dreams</span>. Here in our society we have lost our passion.  <span style="font-weight:bold;">We do not do things because we love to do them.We do things because we feel we have to do them.</span> This is a formula for misery. And I am not speaking of romantic passion, although this is another ingredient for a successful, inspired existence. What I am taking about is a passion for life. Reclaim the joy of waking up every morning, full of energy and exhilaration. Breath the fire of passion into all that you do. You will quickly reap great material, as well as spiritual rewards."</p><br /><iframe src="http://rcm.amazon.com/e/cm?t=m0ba5-20&o=1&p=8&l=bpl&asins=0062515675&fc1=000000&IS2=1&lt1=_blank&m=amazon&lc1=0000FF&bc1=000000&bg1=FFFFFF&f=ifr" style="align:left;padding-top:5px;width:131px;height:245px;padding-right:10px;"align="left" scrolling="no" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" frameborder="0"></iframe><br /><span style="font-style:italic;">Extract from:'The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari' by Robin S Sharma</span><div class="blogger-post-footer">Joe's Blog</div>
