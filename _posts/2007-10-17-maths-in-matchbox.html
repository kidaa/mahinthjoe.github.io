He's put maths in a matchbox,made students get their alcoholic parents to stop drinking and freed classrooms of the caste system. <strong>H S Parameshiah</strong>, who teaches at the government school in Banjarapalya, off Kanakapura Road, is a teacher who walks the talk. And for all these lessons, he'll receive the National Award for Best Teacher<br /><br />His methods for de-mystifying maths with the help of matchboxes are, well, out-of-the-box. Whether it is a plus b the whole squared or cubed, or the Pythagoras Theorem, he uses matchboxes to explain concepts. "<strong>Children can never forget their formulae this way They realise that maths is not difficult to understand</strong>," says Parameshiah.<br /><br />He now conducts teacher training workshops and has also written teachers' guides through the DSERT. But long before that, he'd proved that he was a teacher who went beyond teaching. Years ago, he waged a war against the caste system in school. "<strong>Children of different castes refused to sit to gether in the same class. They practised untouchability</strong>" He explained to them that caste was man-made. And today they all sit together. He adopted the same tactics and met with success, when boys and girls refused to sit in the same rows.<br /><br />In 1995, he got the students to refuse to buy liquor for their parents. "<strong>Parents were getting their children to buy liquor from the shops. I told the children that they were doing something wrong, that drinking was bad for health, and to convey this message to the parents</strong>." But the adults protested. However, the efforts bore fruit. Drinking came down by 50 %, he says proudly<br /><br />Born to illiterate parents, coming from humble beginnings, and having studied the hard way, Parameshaiah learnt that education meant empowerment, and so, he decided to be a teacher when he grew up. Today, his siblings, two brothers and a sister, are also teachers.<br /><br /><em></em><div align="right"><em>An Article in the Times Of India 05 Sep 2007<br /></div></em><div class="blogger-post-footer">Joe's Blog</div>
