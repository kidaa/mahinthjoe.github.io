Its all hormone-driven.Know this feeling? Your heart pounding and you are feeling weak in the knees? When you meet someone you like the look of, or see them across a crowded room, your hormones begin take over. Research has shown that even a first meet with someone can induce your body to release hormones — adrenalin ,noradrenaime, testos and a dash of oxytiese hormones for a few of the symtoms of love—like missing a heart beat, walking on air, and butterflies in the tummy.<br /><br />When they are in love men and woman become more like each other than at any other time. Donatella Marazziti of the University of Pisa in Italy showed that levels of the neurotransmitter serotonin, which has a calming enect,dip below normal in those who say they are in love as well as in people with obsessive compulsive disorder. Both groups spend inordinate amounts of time obsessing about something or someone. Also, "Men, in some way. become more like women, and women become like men," said Marazziti.<br /><br />"It's as If nature wants to elimnate what can be differences in men and woman, because its more important to survive (and mate) at this stage.<br /><br />Other research has shown that falling in love, makes us blind to our partner's faults. IT found that when people look at their lovers, the neural circuits that are normally associated with critical social assessment of other people are suppressed.<br /><br />A study has shown that two years is all you get for a passionate romance before your hormones fail you. Scientists from the university of Pisa used blood tests to estableish levels of a variety of hormones in volunteers —some were just starting out with a new partner, while others had been in a relationship for years.<br /><br />A nerve growth factor called neurotropluns exceeded normal levels m those who were in the early stages of romance..But it was missing from those who'd been together for up to two years.It had been replaced by oxytocin, or'the cuddle hormone'.<div class="blogger-post-footer">Joe's Blog</div>
