<div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size:130%;">My heart is a wasteland<br />so much destruction<br />As my tears fall, they<br />stain broken dreams<br /><br />Once filled with love and<br />hopes I found happiness<br />Was I foolish or naive to<br />believe I deserved love?<br /><br />I don't know how I survived<br />but there's an old saying<br />That which doesn't kill me can<br />only make me stronger<br /><br />It took me so long to pick myself<br />up off the ground as I cried<br />Gathering up the last of my strength<br />to build this immense wall<br /><br />One block at a time, I strain as I<br />lift them into place, and then sigh<br />As I swear with a bitterness that<br />I'll let no one hurt me again<br /><br />Never allowing anyone to walk<br />within my heart, to get to me<br />A wall so thick, so tall, even I<br />would be afraid to go to them<br /><br />Did I ask of them so much, just<br />to share my love and my life?<br />Standing against the harshest winds<br />to endure what life threw at us?<br /><br />I can't lower my defenses, I can't<br />I can't take that chance I cry<br />I hate my loneliness, but behind<br />my wall, I feel no one can hurt me<br /><br />I see other's walking hand in hand<br />I hear them laugh, I see them kiss<br />They make it seem so wonderful<br />to share their life with another<br /><br />But behind this wall I must stay<br />I must buy time to heal<br />All I have to hold onto are my<br />dreams, that I dare to dream<br /><br />That there is someone out there<br />just like me, nervously waiting<br />Will they whisper with their eyes<br />their voice or a poem for a chance?</span>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       </div><div class="blogger-post-footer">Joe's Blog</div>
