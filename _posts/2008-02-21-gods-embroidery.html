I would sit at her knee and look up from the floor and ask what she was doing. She informed me that she was embroidering. I told her that it looked like a mess from where I was, the underside. I watched her work within the boundaries of the little round hoop that she held in her hand.</p><p>She would smile at me, look down and gently say, "My son, you go about your playing for a while, and when I am finished with my embroidering, I will put you on my knee and let you see it from my side."</p><p>I would wonder why she was using some dark threads along with the bright ones and why they seemed so jumbled from my view. </p><p>A few minutes would pass and then I would hear Mother's voice say, "Son, come and sit on my knee."</p><p>This I did, only to be surprised and thrilled to see a beautiful flower or a sunset. I could not believe it, because from underneath it looked so messy.</p><p>Then Mother would say to me, "My son, from underneath it did look messy and jumbled, but you did not realize that there was a pre-drawn plan on the top. It was a design. I was only following it. Now look at it from my side and you will see what I was doing."</p><p>Many times through the years I have looked up to my Heavenly Father and said, "Father, what are You doing?"</p><p>He has answered, "I am embroidering your life."</p><p>I say, "But it looks like a mess to me. It seems so jumbled. The threads seem so dark. Why can't they all be bright?"</p><p>The Father seems to tell me, <strong>"My child, you go about your business of doing My business, and one day I will bring you to Heaven and put you on My knee and you will see the plan from My side." </strong></p><div class="blogger-post-footer">Joe's Blog</div>
