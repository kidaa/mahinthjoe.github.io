If a mans heart is rankling with discord and ill feeling towards you, you can't win him to your way of thinking with all the logic in Christendom. Scolding parents and domineering bosses and husbands and nagging wives or fighting friends ought to realize that <strong>people don't want to change their minds</strong>. They can't be forced or driven to agree with you or me. But they can be possibly led to, if we are gentle and friendly, ever so gentle and ever so friendly.<br /><br /><img style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; WIDTH: 400px; CURSOR: hand; TEXT-ALIGN: center" alt="" src="http://www.dutchgoldhoney.com/store/gif_jpg/tips_drop_of_gold.jpg" border="0" /><br /><p>It is an old and true maxim that "<strong>a drop of honey catches more flies than a gallon of gall</strong> ". So with men, if you would win a man to your cause, first convice him that you are his sincier friend.
