How is such an emotion as sublime as love is trailed by a sentiment as vicious as hate is strictly beyond my reasoning. Some psychotherapist says that's because love &amp; hate are the two sides of the same coin. <img height="180" alt="Image" src="http://static.flickr.com/54/135853383_49931e6ea1_m.jpg" width="240" align="right" border="0" /> One wonders how cruelty and brutality can be meted out to someone who, till a while back, was being showered with love and affection. After all, the end of a relationship doesn't Clean the demise of feelings. Where does the sentiment of exacting vengeance from a former lover really stem from? <p>The family background and a basic breakdown in the value system could be precursors to this phenomenon. In general, family life is disturbed and insecure these days. Even the spirit of competition is overwhelming, as a result of which, people are constantly living on the edge. There's a nagging feeling of dissatisfaction with individuals coveting what they don't have. At present, we are an unstable society, which is through a lot of turbulence, what with new idols and new standards of behavior... Over time, this contributes to pushing people over the edge, which may lead to these violent and stupid acts." <img height="170" alt="Image" src="http://static.flickr.com/19/114157127_a915f5f63e_m.jpg" width="240" align="left" border="0" />Social relationships are undergoing a massive change, with <strong>'acquiring' </strong>a partner uppermost on youngsters' minds. And when losing that partner becomes an imminent threat, the response is brute force. We are living in a violent society that not only propagates aggression, but also gives out feelers that the culprit can get away with minimum punishment. "Have you ever heard of someone getting death penalty for throwing acid on an ex-girlfriend's face? No. And that's the reason such violence continues. <img height="240" alt="Image" src="http://static.flickr.com/49/135853390_955d267698_m.jpg" width="159" align="right" border="0" /> Of course, not every jilted man or heartbroken woman will<br />become an acid-thrower or end one's life. Those with, a paranoid or borderline personality perpetrate these violent and insulting acts. which are generally crimes of passion. They love themselves more than anyone else. "For them. their ego is all important. Narcissists in nature, they cannot see beyond themselves and self-gratification becomes their raison d'etre. Such people cannot tolerate or handle failure. They have to register their protest in a situation that they deem is unfair to them, and they do so in a violent manner," Romantic notions of happily ever-after, unrealistic expectations from relationships and a basic abhorrence of honest open communication &amp; just letting time be the best healer, mar the lives of young people who resort to sordid measures after the end of a relationship. For them, love turns into hate in a matter of seconds... </p><div class="blogger-post-footer">Joe's Blog</div>
