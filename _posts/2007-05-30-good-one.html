A man feared his wife wasn't hearing as well as she used to and he thought she might need a hearing aid. Not quite sure how to approach her, he called the family Doctor to discuss the problem. The Doctor told him there is a simple informal test the husband could perform to give the Doctor a better idea about her hearing loss.<br />Here's what you do," said the Doctor, "stand about 40 feet away from her, and in a normal conversational speaking tone see if she hears you.<br />If not, go to 30 feet, then 20 feet, and s o on until you get a response."<br />That evening, the wife is in the kitchen cooking dinner, and he was in the den. He says to himself, "I'm about 40 feet away, let's see what happens."<br />Then in a normal tone he asks, 'Honey, what's for dinner?"<br />No response.<br />So the husband moves to closer to the kitchen, about 30 feet from his wife and repeats, "Honey, what's for dinner?"<br />Still no response.<br />Next he moves into the dining room where he is about 20 feet from his<br />wife and asks, Honey, what's for dinner?"<br />Again he gets no response so,<br />He walks up to the kitchen door, about 10 feet away. "Honey, what's for dinner?"<br />Again there is no response.<br />So he walks right up behind her. "Honey, what's for dinner?"<br />;<br />;<br />;<br />;<br />;<br />;<br />;<br />;<br />;<br />;<br />;<br />;<br />;<br />;<br />;<br />;<br />"James, for the FIFTH time I've said, CHICKEN!"<br />Moral of the story:<br /><strong>The problem may not be with the other one as we always think, could be very much within us..!</strong><div class="blogger-post-footer">Joe's Blog</div>
