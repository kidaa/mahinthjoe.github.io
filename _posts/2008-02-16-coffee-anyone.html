The conversation soon turned into complaints about stress in work and life... Offering his guests coffee, the professor went to the kitchen and returned with a large pot of coffee and an assortment of cups â€” porcelain, plastic, glass, crystal, some plain looking, some expensive, some exquisite telling them to help themselves to hot coffee. <br /><br />When all the students had a cup of coffee in hand, the professor said:<br /><br />"If you noticed, all the nice looking expensive cups were taken up, leaving behind the plain and cheap ones.It is but normal for you to want only the best for yourselves, that is the source of your problems and stress."<br /><br />What all of you really wanted was coffee, not the cup, but you consciously went for the best cups and were eyeing each other's cups. <strong>"Now if life is coffee, and the jobs, money and position in society are the cups."</strong> They are just tools to hold life, but the quality of life doesn't change. <br /><br />Sometimes, by concentrating only on the cup, we fail to enjoy the coffee in it. So, don't let the cups drive you... enjoy the coffee instead... <br /><object height="385" width="480"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/U3NgzQ9Pcsg?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/U3NgzQ9Pcsg?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="480" height="385"></embed></object><br />Thanks @Iain2008<div class="blogger-post-footer">Joe's Blog</div>
