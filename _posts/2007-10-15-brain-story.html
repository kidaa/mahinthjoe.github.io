Somehow, that mass of grey sludge locked inside our skulls creates a whole inner world heaving with emotions, memories, ideas and desires. Everything we see, touch, hear and feel - the illusion of reality - is generated by this inscrutable organ. For centuries scientists have probed the brain, searching for clues that might shed light on its mysterious workings। Recently, however, with the advent of modern technology and developments in neuroscience, the brain has begun to yield its secrets. The time is ripe to start to make sense of how the brain becomes a mind and how it accounts for our uniquely differing personalities.<br /><br />In this highly readable and often mind-boggling tour, Susan Greenfield brings the reader up to date on the latest theories and controversies. Drawing on the personal stories of many individuals and talking to a wide range of scientists in many parts of the world, she tackles head-on the big questions that touch on all our lives, Where are memories stored? Are our brains a product of nature or nurture? Will we ever build thinking robots? And are free will and consciousness nothing more than illusions produced by the subconscious mind?<br />Bringing together the different threads of what we are learning now about the brain, Brain Story gives fascinating new insights into what makes you you.<br /><strong>Fine television। Shouldn't be missed. </strong><br /><br /><div align="justify"><a href="http://torrentspy.com/torrent/1171976/BBC_Brain_Story_1of6_All_in_the_Mind_XviD_AC3_NewMov_avi">Episode 1: All in the Mind</a><br />Greenfield talks to a woman having brain surgery while awake and relates the story of a stroke victim who cannot recognise tunes but knows whether music is happy or sad. This Video will take you inside the living brain, really. So those offended by seeing it please dont Actually It is an warning to this video only.This video Starts itself with a patient fully awake lying in a Operating table, and doctors working on her brain exposed through her head split wide open, I'm sure it sounds pretty scary but it is the best possible way I could describe it and it relly is that. Personally I found it to be pretty neat video with no gross images linked with an opearation but a prett neat &amp; real life video of the inner workings of the brain. Guess it helped me put the rest of the videos which are more of everyday normal life of various patients in a proper prespective ;-)<br /></div><div align="justify"> </div><div align="justify"><a href="http://torrentspy.com/torrent/1171977/BBC_Brain_Story_2of6_In_the_Heat_of_the_Moment_XviD_AC3_NewMov_avi">Episode 2: In the Heat of the Moment </a><br />The complex workings of the brain continue to be explored in Brain Story The Biochemistry of Feelings. In this episode, Susan Greenfield addresses the subject of emotions, explaining how the six human emotions affect many aspects of our lives. Combining historic ideas about the brain with current theories, Greenfield presents intriguing information regarding the origin of emotional responses. She uses the data of scientists from many parts of the world.<br /></div><div align="justify"> </div><div align="justify"><a href="http://torrentspy.com/torrent/1171978/BBC_Brain_Story_3of6_The_Minds_Eye_XviD_AC3_NewMov_avi">Episode 3: The Mind's Eye </a><br />The Mind's Eye. Greenfield explores how the brain interprets what our eyes see, while patients with rare forms of brain damage provide dramatic insights into how this affects their view of the world.<br /></div><div align="justify"><a href="http://torrentspy.com/torrent/1171979/BBC_Brain_Story_4of6_First_Among_Equals_XviD_AC3_NewMov_avi">Episode 4: First Among Equals </a><br />Look at why humans are so good at planning ahead and working towards a goal, plus a search for the roots of our linguistic abilities.<br /></div><div align="justify"> </div><div align="justify"><a href="http://torrentspy.com/torrent/1171980/BBC_Brain_Story_5of6_Growing_the_Mind_XviD_AC3_NewMov_avi">Episode 5: Growing the Mind</a><br />Greenfield examines the brain's adaptability and proposes that human personality develops when our life experiences cause physical changes in the connections between the brain's cells.<br /></div><div align="justify"><a href="http://torrentspy.com/torrent/1171981/BBC_Brain_Story_6of6_The_Final_Mystery_XviD_AC3_NewMov_avi">Episode 6: The Final Mystery</a><br />Professor Susan Greenfield grapples with the paradoxical idea that the apparently immeasurable phenomenon of consciousness is actually generated by the very physical processes of the brain.<br /></div><div align="justify"> </div><div align="justify">It is a six part series covering virtually every area of contemporary neuropsychology, including the major researchers, discoveries, techniques and even many of the patients who have been the subjects of classic case studies that have helped us understand the curious effects of brain injury.<br /></div><div align="justify">It is presented by neuroscientist Prof Susan Greenfield and sadly has never been made available , despite it being both a fine teaching aid and completely compelling viewing. I've noticed that probably one of the best TV series on psychology and neuroscience ever produced, the BBC's Brain Story, is available on public bittorrent servers for download. It's a landmark series in its accuracy and scope, and because it's so engrossing for both the seasoned professional and the general viewer.<br /></div>Note: <em><span style="font-size:85%;">If you dont have software to download torrent file such as the link above go to </span></em><a href="http://www.utorrent.com/"><em><span style="font-size:85%;">http://www.utorrent.com/</span></em></a><em><span style="font-size:85%;"> to download one Torrent Client which will help you download the torrent links above. </span></em><div class="blogger-post-footer">Joe's Blog</div>
