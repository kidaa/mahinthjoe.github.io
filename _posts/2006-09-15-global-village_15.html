The Global Village - the great "melting pot" - has always been a rich blend of cultural traditions from all over the world. Many families can trace their histories to immigrant ancestors who traveled great distances, enduring risk and hardship, to make a home where they would be guaranteed basic freedoms. And for many of them these freedoms came with a struggle.<br />Human society was founded on freedom from religious persecution and on tolerance of differences in beliefs and cultural heritage. The differences (or diversity) among from people from all over the world enrich our culture, bringing new ideas and energy. Today, more than ever, people have opportunities to interact with people of differing ethnicities, religions, and cultures. The Global Village is increasingly diverse, reflecting the communities where people live and work.<br /><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold"></span><br /><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">A World of Difference:</span><br />Some people welcome the fact that we live in an increasingly diverse society. Others may feel more hesitant, especially if they have not had much exposure to people different from themselves. Many are way ahead of their peers in terms of exposure to cultural differences. Their circle of friends and associates are much more varied than those of even a generation ago.<br />Why is it important for us to help each other, prepare to live, learn, and work in communities that will become even more diverse?<br /><br />Teaching tolerance is important not just because it is part of our human heritage but because the person who learns to be open to differences will have more opportunity - in education, in business, in career and in so many other ways.<br /><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold"></span><br /><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">In short, your success depends on it. Success in today's world - and tomorrow's depends on being able to understand, appreciate, and work with others.<br /><br /><em>SREE NIDHI S K<br />Oscar Murphy International<br />Life Strategists, Behavioral Trainers, Coaches & Change Agents<br />Email: sree@oscarmurphy.com<br />Phone: Mobile: 91 9343714606 Office: 91 80 41161534 / 35<br />Singapore &amp; Bangalore<br />Web: www.oscarmurphy.com</em><br /></span><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold"></span><div class="blogger-post-footer">Joe's Blog</div>
