There is nothing in the world easier than goodness and nothing more difficult than depravity. By <strong>'goodness'</strong> is meant a tranquillity of mind, undisturbed by cupidity. By <strong>'depravity'</strong> is meant a grasping spirit with many cravings. He who is satisfied with the simple needs of his nature, refusing the superfluous delights of the world, will not be tempted by any seductions. He who follows the law of his nature, will preserve his soul, without any inward conflicts. Hence the statement <strong>'It is easy to be good'</strong>. Clambering up city walls, scaling dangerous heights, thieving the official keys, forging &amp; stealing offical money, rebelling and murdering, lying and bearing false witness, are acts contrary to human nature. Hence the saying <strong>'It is difficult to be bad'</strong><br /><div align="right">Huai Nan Tzu</div><div class="blogger-post-footer">Joe's Blog</div>
