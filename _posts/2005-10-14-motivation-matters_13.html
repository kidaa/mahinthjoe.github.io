It's time for mid-term exams so I thought that I must share some motivation techniques with you. The idea is that if you can master; these techniques, now then you will find them very helpful to improve your performance in the final exams. I would like confess that each of these techniques were developed by me during college years and I helped me a great deal. I even feel that no amount of motivation skills can help you as much as these techniques that I am to share with you. The reason why I rate these techniques above the rest is because they are all self-motivating techniques. Thus you do not have to rely on others for motivation to study. Surprisingly, many people have told me these techniques have helped them to improve their concentration as well. Here are some tips, which will help you to get on with your books and help you retain your concentration while you prepare for your exams.<br /><br />Do it for your parents.<br />Every time you do not feel like studying, just close your eyes and visualise your father or your mother. Visualise them in pain, visualise them crying for you. Visualise that all your relatives and friends are raising a figure at your parents and ridiculing them for they always speak great things about you and you have done very badly in your exams. Imagine" your parents being humiliated. Now ask yourself a question would you like to ever see your parents in this kind of a state? Our parents who bring us to this world, who give us everything that we have today food, cloth-ing, shelter, education, love, care and understanding. Parents who never expect anything for them- selves but just want to see you happy and successful. Can't we do so much for our parents? So, if , you find difficulty in settling down to study just remember your parents and dedicate your day's work to your parents.<br /><br />Do it for the one you love.<br />If you really like a person then you have to work hard to make yourself successful, work hard so that you can stand on "your feet, build a successful career, earn name and fame. It is your effort and sacrifices that will help you earn a good reputation. In the long run this is what a partner looks for. So, if you love someone do not waste you time. Instead use it constructively and dedicate your education for the one you love. Eventually, if you get to live your life with that person then you will be happy because you can give him or her a great future. However, in a context where this person does not become yours even then you will have a sense of satisfaction that you succeeded in life because of her. Either ways it helps you to grow instead of wasting your time and life.<br /><br />Reward and punish yourself<br />This is a great technique to discipline yourself during exam time. Set yourself a work plan for a week. Attach some incentive to it, for example, you can reward yourself by going out with your friends or go for a movie or buy music. Now, if you are able to complete this work on time then go out and celebrate your success. But in case you are not able to finish your work in time then punish yourself by not going out. This technique will help you set goals and also achieve them by regulating your life around these weekly goals. In fact, mastering this technique can help you a great deal in other aspects of you life as well.<br /><br />Spring out<br />Exams and cricket have a strange relationship, I always see them coming at the same time year after year. Many students are so much into cricket that they even compromise on their study hours to find time to watch cricket. Let me ask you a couple of questions: What will happen if India wins? Now my other question: What if India looses? You will either feel happy or feel sad and absolutely nothing else. Correct? Irrespective of the result of the game, Sachin and Shewag will get richer by a few more lakhs of rupees. Now, think for a moment you are actually watching cricket for over six hours in a day with no real gain. Is that really worth it especially when you are loosing out , on   your   education? Watching cricket for long hours can make you lazy and you will eventually not study for the entire day. My suggestion is that the moment you realise that you need to go study, just spring out of your chair at once and go into your room and start studying. Springing out helps because it will get you out of the gravitational pull and also make your tired mind feel fresh. Remember I am not against cricket or any other sports, all I am saying is that it is not worth wasting your time watching TV dicing your exam time. You can watch the highlights or the news or even see the first five and last five overs of a match to get a flavour of things and yet be updated.<br /><br />Psyche yourself.<br />Think of any one person that you have come across who has not really' achieved anything in life, someone who has failed in all aspects of life, someone who lives a very ordinary life. Now every time you do not feel like studying think of this person and ask yourself whether you want to become like that. Scare yourself by saying that you may also land up becoming like him. That's enough reason for you to study. A regular dose of such reminders work like simple motivation for you to keep studying and doing well in life. The fear of failure has helped hundreds of people from different fields to succeed.<br /><br />So, go ahead and master these techniques. Use them as per your needs and maximise results. Look forward to see you on the top in everything that you do. Good luck!<br /><br />(The writer is the Founder-Director of the Kapoor's Workshop on Effective Communication)<div class="blogger-post-footer">Joe's Blog</div>
