<div class="google_header" id="google_header"><h1>Create your body of work</h1><h6><br /><br /><br /><div id="f.nz" style="text-align: left;"><a href="http://docs.google.com/File?id=dchtgczg_292jzdwqrgk_b" target="_blank"><img src="http://docs.google.com/File?id=dchtgczg_292jzdwqrgk_b" style="height: 162px; width: 160px;" /></a>&nbsp;<b><span style="font-size: x-small;">LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL</span></b></div></h6><h5 style="text-align: right;">Robin Sharma</h5></div><span style="font-size: small;">It is early morning as I write this. Relaxing in my library. Listening to Luciano Ligabue, an extraordinary italian rock star who I got introduced to in Rome and whose music has been shaking the foundation of our home for the past few weeks. And I'm reflecting about Leadership and life.</span><br /><span style="font-size: small;">I read a little piece in an issue of </span><i><span style="font-size: small;">Vanity Fair</span></i><span style="font-size: small;"> on Art Butchwald, the writer , 80, when he was battling kidney failure. ( Butchwald passed away on January 17, 2007), Coming close to death brings a human nearer to what's more important in life. Brings tremendous clarity. Strips away all the accessories that we think are so essential when we are younger. Connects us with the truth ( and truth sets you free doesn't it?)</span><br /><span style="font-size: small;">He was asked "Whats is your idea of perfect happiness?" <b>"Being Healthy"</b> was the reply. He was asked "Which talent would you most like to have?" <b>"Living"</b> was the reply. Then he was asked "What is your most treasured possession?" <b>"All of my 32 books and all of my columns."</b> . The point of wisdom that you and I can take away? Greatness comes when you create something with your life that is not only bigger but outlasts you. Legitimacy and recognition and prestige and material things are all fine and are all very human pursuit. But there is something far more important: <b>legacy</b>. Making a difference. Having an impact. Creating something special. And meaningful.</span><br /><span style="font-size: small;">What body of work will you create over life so that generations who follow will know that you've been here ?What bold acts and brave moves will you make at this moment to let the greatness that slumbers within you come out and visit the light of this very day? What will your " most treasured possession" look like? And , at the end, what will you have done with all that talent with which you have been blessed? Just wondering.</span><br /><div class="google_footer" id="google_footer"><br /><iframe align="left" frameborder="0" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0" scrolling="no" src="http://rcm.amazon.com/e/cm?t=m0ba5-20&amp;o=1&amp;p=8&amp;l=bpl&amp;asins=155468403X&amp;fc1=000000&amp;IS2=1&amp;lt1=_blank&amp;m=amazon&amp;lc1=0000FF&amp;bc1=000000&amp;bg1=FFFFFF&amp;f=ifr" style="height: 245px; padding-right: 10px; padding-top: 5px; width: 131px;"></iframe><br /><span style="font-size: small;">--Excerpted from The Greatness Guide 2 by ROBIN SHARMA.&nbsp;</span><i><span style="font-size: small;">Published by Jaico Publishing House</span></i><span style="font-size: small;">, jaicopub@vsnl.com</span>&nbsp;</div><img alt="share" border="0" src="http://www.socialmarker.com/bookmark.gif" /><a href="http://www.socialmarker.com/">Social Bookmarking</a><br /><a href="http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php" name="fb_share" type="button_count">Facebook Share</a><div class="blogger-post-footer">Joe's Blog</div>
