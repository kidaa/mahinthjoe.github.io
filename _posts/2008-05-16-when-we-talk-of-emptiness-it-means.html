In other words a certain kind of determination not to give away, not to open up. We would like to keep everything intact surely for the purpose of security, of knowing where we are.<b id="u1:e0">"You are afraid to change"</b> that sort of solidness is form<b id="u1:e1">.<br id="yttd5"></b><br id="yttd6"></p><p id="f3-b4">So "<b id="yttd7">Form is Empty</b>" is the absence of security; you see everything as penentrating and open. But that dosent mean everything has to be completely formless or nothing. When we talk of nothingness , emptiness or voidness we are not talking in terms of negatives but in terms of nothingness being everything.It's another way of saying "<b id="sw0c0">everything</b>" - but it is much safer to say "<b id="sw0c1">nothing</b>" at that particular level than "<b id="sw0c2">everything</b>"<br id="yttd8"></p><p id="u9gl0"></p><br /><p><object width="425" height="355"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/K4LnV0gC_X0&hl=en"></param><param name="wmode" value="transparent"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/K4LnV0gC_X0&hl=en" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" wmode="transparent" width="425" height="355"></embed></object></p><br /><p id="p42o0">"<a id="f5mx" title="Link to YouTube Everything or Nothing Video" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4LnV0gC_X0" target="_blank">Everything or Nothing" on YouTube</a></p><div class="blogger-post-footer">Joe's Blog</div>
