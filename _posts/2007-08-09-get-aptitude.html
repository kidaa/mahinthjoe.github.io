Different people are good at different things. So says received wisdom and it is widely accepted as a way to determine your aptitude for something. Which is why you might be terrible at working out mathematical solutions but are a wizard at negotiating mind-boggling traffic in a bustling metro. Which is also why, increasingly, recruitment procedures in many corporations include aptitude tests.<br /><br />Hold on. Surviving rush hour means — particularly if you're behind the wheel — your brain is engaged in a continuous process of working out probabilities within a punishing time frame. Will that cow bang in the middle of the road move forward or backward? Is that speed freak behind preparing to overtake my vehicle from the right or left? Will the man dithering on the divider's edge suddenly dash across the road? If you've got these probabilities all worked out in a flash and got them right, ell, you're a math wizard, <em>so to speak</em>.<br /><br />So what's aptitude?<br /><br />Koreans have an aptitude for micromanipulation in the laboratory, a procedure essential in nanotechnology and stem cell research. A report spoke of Korean "tweezer dexterity", a skill that comes handy indeed in biotechnology and nano particle research. The 'aptitude' is being attributed to the Korean tradition of eating meals with tapering steel chopsticks unlike other similar cultures where wood is still being used for the purpose. So, is aptitude intrinsic or acquired? Johnson O'Connor, the American who pioneered aptitude testing, formulated the Tweezer Dexterity Test in the early 20th century to screen suitable candidates for a career as hair transplantation technicians. From hair to here, inundated regularly with news of path-breaking scientific innovations and relatively greater access to resources, individual aptitudes — acquired or otherwise — might no longer be as important as the ability to work effectively as part of a professional and increasingly multilingual, multicultural and multitalented global team.<br /><br />In a future context, normal protocol might expect you to go get an aptitude — maybe through practice, genetic engineering or bionic enhancement — to suit the job, and not the other way around. So it's most likely going to be curtains for the hunt for natural talent.<br /><br /><div align="right"><em>by NarayaniGanesh in Times Of india Fri Aug 3 Mind Opener</em></div><div class="blogger-post-footer">Joe's Blog</div>
