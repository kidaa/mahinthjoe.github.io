The trait is '<strong>envy</strong>' and it rears its ugly head in the form of "<strong>Tall Poppy Syndrome</strong>". It seems that when someone in our society lifts himself up above the "<strong>norm</strong>", people are waiting to somehow drag them down. People will belittle the achievements of others at every opportunity usually finding some negative and insignificant factor and using it to embarrass the person in question. I am still wondering whether to allow myself to become one of the flock. From the way things are going I will be a part of this group soon if I am not already.</div><div class="blogger-post-footer">Joe's Blog</div>
