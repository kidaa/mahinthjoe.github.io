Forcing ourself to do the harder things in life makes us stronger people.Just look at the way the military has trained its soilders for many years. They put their men through arduous, back breaking, sessions and routines to prepare them for the worst. They are well prepared for the atrocius conditions imaginable. If they have survuived the training they can take on anything. This is the way we must see our sacrifice, or going without. It should be viewed as a training for life. It is going to make us better people.<br /><br />If we are to bake a cake, we must first gather and arrange all our ingredients. Carefully measuring the seperate parts of a mixture, we combine all the ingredients until we obtain the desired consistency for the mixture.After all the important preperations are done, we place the baking tin in the oven and wait until the cake is cooked completely. It is only once all this is done that we enjoy the fruits of our labour.<br /><br />Life is very similar to baking a cake. Do not expect to throw all the ingredients together and eat the cake before baking it. The fun is in watching the cake mixture rise, planning  the icing that you desire and anticipating the firt bite of your moist treat. How good does it taste after you have put all that time and energy into its preperation? It tastes good dosen't it? Much better than the bought cake.<div class="blogger-post-footer">Joe's Blog</div>
