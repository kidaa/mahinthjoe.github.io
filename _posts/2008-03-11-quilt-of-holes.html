Before each of us we laid our lives like the squares of a quilt in many piles; an angel sat before each of us sewing our quilt squares together into a tapestry that was our life.<br /><br />As my angel took each piece of cloth off the pile, i noticed, to my horror, how ragged and empty each of my squares was. They were filled with giant holes. Each square was labelled with a part of my life that had been difficult, the challenges and temptations i was faced with in every day life. I saw hardships that i endured, which were the largest holes of all. I glanced around me. Nobody else had such squares. Other than a tiny hole here and there, their tapestries were filled with rich colours <a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_Z0_Yj69ls8Q/R9auHYGwtoI/AAAAAAAABdI/Po_o5rmPNmM/s1600-h/quiltshow3-723322.jpg"><img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5176516263462090370" style="FLOAT: left; MARGIN: 0px 10px 10px 0px; CURSOR: hand" alt="" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_Z0_Yj69ls8Q/R9auHYGwtoI/AAAAAAAABdI/Po_o5rmPNmM/s200/quiltshow3-723322.jpg" border="0" /></a>and the bright hues of worldly fortune. I gazed upon my own life and was disheartened.<br /><br />My angel was sewing the ragged pieces of cloth together, threadbare and empty; it seemed like binding air. Finally the time came when each life was to be displayed, held up to the light, the scrutiny of truth. The others rose; each in turn, holding up their tapestries. So filled their lives had been. My angel looked upon me, and nodded for me to rise. My gaze dropped to the ground in shame. I hadn't had all the earthly fortunes. I had love in my life, and laughter. But there had also been trials of illness, and wealth, and false accusations that took from me my world, as i knew it. I had to start over many times. I often struggled with the temptation to quit, only to somehow muster the strength to pick up and begin again. I spent many nights en my knees in prayer, asking for help and guidance in my life. I had often been held up to ridicule, which i endured painfully, each time offering it up to the Father in the hope that i would not melt within my skin beneath the judgmental gaze of those who unfairly judged me.<br /><br />Now, the time had come; <a href="http://www.luegerkirche.at/verklaerung.jpg"><img style="FLOAT: right; MARGIN: 0px 0px 10px 10px; WIDTH: 320px; CURSOR: hand" alt="" src="http://www.luegerkirche.at/verklaerung.jpg" border="0" /></a><br /><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_Z0_Yj69ls8Q/R9astIGwtnI/AAAAAAAABdA/R9nxpo5rQVA/s1600-h/ban-prog.jpg"></a><br />I had to face the truth. My life was what it was, and i had to accept it for what it was. I rose and slowly lifted the combined squares of my life to the light. An awe-filled gasp filled the air. I gazed around at others who stared at me with wide eyes. Then, i looked upon the tapestry before me. Light flooded the many holes, creating an image, the face of Christ. Then our Lord stood before me, with warmth and love in His eyes. He said, "<strong>Every time you gave over your life to Me, it became. My life, My hardships, and My struggles</strong>". <div><div><div><br /><div><br /><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_Z0_Yj69ls8Q/R9asHoGwtmI/AAAAAAAABc4/L8mhZP2mDiY/s1600-h/photo_italy2.jpg"><img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5176514068733802082" style="FLOAT: left; MARGIN: 0px 10px 10px 0px; CURSOR: hand" alt="" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_Z0_Yj69ls8Q/R9asHoGwtmI/AAAAAAAABc4/L8mhZP2mDiY/s320/photo_italy2.jpg" border="0" /></a> Each point of light in your life is when you stepped aside and let Me shine through, until there was more of Me than there was of you." I was overwhelmed. It was wonderful. May all our quilts be threadbare and worn, allowing Christ to shine through! <strong>God determines who walks into your life... it's up to you to decide who you let walk away</strong>, who you let stay, and who you refuse to let go. When there is nothing left but God that is when you find out that God is all you need â€” to let the light shine through.<br /><div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="blogger-post-footer">Joe's Blog</div>
