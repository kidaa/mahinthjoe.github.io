Because, by nature, people are always thinking and forming judgments, many of us take for granted that all of our thinking is of good quality. Consider it yourself: When was the last time you took a moment to sit back and analyze the validity of a particular idea or opinion you had? If you're like most people, it probably wasn't very recently.<br /><br />Unfortunately, individuals typically rely on stereotypes or other mental shortcuts to make quick judgments. As a result, accuracy is often traded for speed. If you look back on times in your own life when you've found yourself in hot water, you may indeed find that many of them were due to mistakes in your judgment or reasoning.<br /><br />You can improve your reasoning skills by varying the methods you use to make judgments from now on. For instance, when a decision you have to make isn't very important, such as, "Should I have the decaf latte or the double espresso?" go ahead and rely on your quick wits. However, when the decision is a more crucial one, such as, <strong>"What do I think of this job candidate?"</strong> <strong>consider slowing down to question what is making up the basis for your judgment</strong>.<br /><br />You may find that your thought process isn't as rational as you would like to believe. For instance, have you ever formed a negative impression of someone just because they resembled a person you didn't like? Poor generalizations like this one make it all the more important that you allow yourself extra time to honestly assess your initial conclusions. In each new situation, ask yourself if you've made any generalizations without sufficient proof. Also determine whether you've dismissed certain viewpoints because they didn't jibe with your own. By taking steps like these to enhance your critical analysis, you can discover the power of abstract thinking in your daily life<div class="blogger-post-footer">Joe's Blog</div>
