Stephen William Hawking, the greatest of the living cosmologists and physicists, was bom in Oxford, England, on the 8th of January 1942. After his schooling, he joined<br/>University College, Oxford and studied Physics. After a first class degree in Natural Sciences he went to Cambridge to do research in Cosmology. Since 1979, he has held the post of Professor of Mathematics, the one held by Isaac Newton in 1663.<br/><br/>Stephen Hawking has worked on the basic laws which govern the universe. With Roger Penrose, he analysed Einstein's Theory of Relativity. He showed that space and time would have a beginning in the Big Bang and an end in black holes. On the basis of the analysis of this phenomenon, he stated that the way the universe began was determined by the laws of science. Professor Hawking has twelve honorary degrees. He was awarded many medals and prizes.<br/><br/>Well, there is more to the life of this eminent physicist. As a child, his movements used to be clumsy and unsteady. He fell over once or twice for no reason at all. Shortly after his 21st birthday, he was taken to hospital and made to undergo a number of tests. He was shocked, when he realised he had an incurable disease, a type of sclerosis, which weakened his muscles. The physicians predicted an early death for him.<br/><br/>He went back to Cambridge and carried on his research in general relativity and cosmology. He was not able to make much progress. He thought that he might not live for long&nbsp;&nbsp; and that his Ph.D. would never be completed. However he finished it.<br/><br/>As his scientific reputation increased, his disability got worse. Even feeding himself, and getting in and out of bed, became difficult. In 1980, he had to rely upon private nurses,<br/>who came in for an hour or two in the morning and evening. In 1985 he underwent an operation in the wind-pipe. After this, he needed 24 hour nursing care. Before the operation, his speech was not clear, but at least he could communicate. But the<br/>operation removed his ability to speak altogether. The only way he could communicate was to spell out words letter by letter.<br/><br/>This was done by raising his eyebrows when someone pointed to the right letter on a spelling card. However a computer program specially devised for him, helped him to select words from a series of menus on the screen by pressing a switch in his hand. After he had formed what he wanted to say, he sent it to a speech synthesizer. A portable computer and a speech synthesizer were fitted to his wheel chair, which allowed him to<br/>communicate much better. Using this system, a book has been written, and dozens of scientific papers have been presented. Many scientific talks have also been given.<br/><br/>Stephen Hawking has never been healthy throughout his adult life. Yet it has not prevented him from having a very happy family life, and being successful in his work. He<br/>continues his research in Physics. He has been travelling and delivering public lectures, though it is quite taxing.<br/><br/>He has exhibited remarkable survival skills and has dared to defy misfortune. His&nbsp;&nbsp;philosophy of life has been very positive. From his career-graph it is understood that one need not lose hope. His life is an example that disability need not prevent one from reaching great heights. Grit and determination are his formulae to overcome crises. From his life it is clear that the emphasis is on will power. If there is a will, one need hardly<br/>struggle to find a way. For the mind can triumph over matter!<div class="blogger-post-footer">Joe's Blog</div>
