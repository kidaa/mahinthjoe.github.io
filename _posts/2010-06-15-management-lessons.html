<b>Lesson four</b><br /><div style="color: blue;"><span style="font-size: large;">One fine day, a bus driver went to the bus garage, started his bus, and drove off along the route. No problems for the first few stops - a few people got on, a few got off, and things went generally well.</span></div><div style="color: blue;"><span style="font-size: large;"><br /></span></div><div style="color: blue;"><span style="font-size: large;">At the next stop, however, a big hulk of a Pathan got on. Six feet four, built like a wrestler, arms hanging down to the ground. He glared at the conductor and said, "Pathan doesn't pay!" and sat down at the back.</span></div><div style="color: blue;"><span style="font-size: large;"><br /></span></div><div style="color: blue;"><span style="font-size: large;">Conductor didn't argue with Pathan, but he wasn't happy about it. The next day the same thing happened â€“ Pathan got on again, made a show of refusing to pay, and sat down. And the next day, and the next..</span></div><div style="color: blue;"><span style="font-size: large;"><br /></span></div><div style="color: blue;"><span style="font-size: large;">This grated on the bus driver, who started losing sleep over the way Pathan was taking advantage of poor conductor. Finally he could stand it no longer. He signed up for body building courses, karate, judo, and all that good stuff.</span></div><div style="color: blue;"><span style="font-size: large;"><br /></span></div><div style="color: blue;"><span style="font-size: large;">By the end of the summer, he had become quite strong; what's more, he felt really good about himself. So, on the next Monday, when Pathan once again got on the bus and said, "Pathan doesn't pay!"</span></div><div style="color: blue;"><span style="font-size: large;"><br /></span></div><div style="color: blue;"><span style="font-size: large;">The driver stood up, glared back at Pathan, and screamed, "And why not?"</span></div><div style="color: blue;"><span style="font-size: large;"><br /></span></div><div style="color: blue;"><span style="font-size: large;">With a surprised look on his face, Pathan replied, "Pathan has a bus pass."</span></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_Z0_Yj69ls8Q/TBdCR_XdCLI/AAAAAAAAEos/dd2f_Lnabf0/s1600/Pathan.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_Z0_Yj69ls8Q/TBdCR_XdCLI/AAAAAAAAEos/dd2f_Lnabf0/s320/Pathan.jpg" /></a></div><br /><span style="color: orange; font-size: large;"><b>Management Lesson</b></span>: <span style="color: blue; font-size: large;">Be sure there is a problem in the first place before working hard to solve one.</span><br /><br />Related Posts<br /><a href="http://mahinth.blogspot.com/2008/02/management-lessons.html">Management Lessons on Feb 4 2008</a><br /><a href="javascript:window.location = 'http://www.socialmarker.com/?link='+encodeURIComponent (location.href)+'&title='+encodeURIComponent( document.title);"><img src= "http://www.socialmarker.com/bookmark.gif" border="0" alt="share" /></a><noscript><a href="http://www.socialmarker.com">Social Bookmarking</a></noscript><br /><iframe src="http://www.facebook.com/plugins/like.php?href=http%3A%2F%2Fexample.com%2Fpage%2Fto%2Flike&amp;layout=standard&amp;show_faces=true&amp;width=450&amp;action=like&amp;colorscheme=light&amp;height=80" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="border:none; overflow:hidden; width:450px; height:80px;" allowTransparency="true"></iframe><div class="blogger-post-footer">Joe's Blog</div>
