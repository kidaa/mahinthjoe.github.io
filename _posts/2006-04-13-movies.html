The other day I went for a couple of movies and it was a refreshing change to have seen hindi movies become more of a psycological thriller. Well its been quite some time for me to get enough time and patience to see hours long flick but these couple of movies were a welcome change from the girl chasing boys around trees and singing songs which incidently was what I expected. Whats important is the characters and their idealogies have changed completely. Its no longer about girl & boy whatever is there that is just to keep the movie to fitted into the bollywood mainstream. <br />In Rang De Basanti it was a bunch of boys taking law into their own hands and ultimately....Watchable Movie according to me. On the negative side 2 years down the line who will ever give a damn about them things will be again back to square one. The point to be noted is the exact portrayl of how this country runs, also the only people who can do anything about it is we who are living in it, wondering how many of them ever got this concept which the movie is about. <br />Taxi No9211 was another refreshing break .I really could relate myself to both the characters and their sentiments and dont hold both of them responsible for whatever happened between them. Each was so possesive about his own priorities. What sometimes works for some people is watching a movie. Believe it or not, watching someone else express the same things you're feeling can take the pressure off.<div class="blogger-post-footer">Joe's Blog</div>
