And more importantly, what's your perception of the thing? Have you ever thought for a moment that your actions are guided by your perceptions? In various life situations, we invariably act in accordance with our perception of things. Different people perceive things differently.So, it's not what you merely see matters,because we all see the same thing.What matters more is our perception of the world around us - people, ideals and events at home and at the work place.<br id="xfxy5"><br id="xfxy6">Which forces one to ask: How do you see and perceive things around you?<br id="xfxy7"><br id="xfxy8">Simply put, perceptions are views of a person in a given situation. And perceptions do matter a lot. Your observation of people determines the way you interact with them. Two individuals can have totally different perceptions of a painting.Similarly, a source of panic for one person could be a challenge for another. How you perceive a problem is the key to how you solve it.<br id="xfxy9">Most importantly, your perception of yourself will determine who you are as a person, your career choices and how effectively you deal with life and work. Your perceptions will form the basis for your decisions, judgements, attitudes, emotions,choices and the like.<br id="xfxy10"><br id="xfxy11">How you see will determine how you act.<br id="xfxy12"><span id="xfxy13"  style="color:#ff7f00;"><br id="xfxy14"><span style="font-size:100%;color:#ff0000;"><b>Seeing Red</b></span></span><span style="font-size:100%;"><b>:</b></span> At home as well as at the work place, we are busy reacting to the red rags that are waved at us. Our perception that work needs to be done in a certain way powers us instinctively. Everybody operates from his or her own point of reference.<br id="xfxy15">So, just as you judge their output according to your own perception, they did it according to theirs. For example, say the students who joined management school this year were born in 1983! Each one of them is bound to have a perception of their own!<br id="xfxy16">People who are aware of their motivations and that of others as well, take more effective decisions, rather than waste their time reacting. Open your eyes to others'perceptions and see more than the red rag.<br id="xfxy17"><br id="xfxy18"><span id="xfxy19"  style="color:#6000bf;"><span style="font-size:100%;"><span style="color:#0000ff;"><b>Feeling Blue</b></span>:</span></span> Often, perceptions cloud our vision. If something does not turn out in a particular way we are disappointed. If we lose out on a business deal, we foresee a heavy loss. This blue feeling comes from our perception of failure, of not being able to achieve a goal.<br id="xfxy20">The perception of failure as the end is a crippling one. Successful people take failure as a stepping-stone to success and lessons to leam from. They haven't eliminated failure but have changed their perception of it. The meaning of something changes, if it is viewed differently. For instance, perceive those Monday morning blues as a blue indicative of a clear sky and another chance to begin anew.<br id="xfxy21"><br id="xfxy22">Questioning <span style="font-size:100%;"><span id="xfxy23"  style="color:#000000;"><span id="xfxy24"  style="color:#ffffff;"><span style="color:#000000;">Black</span><span style="color:#000000;"> and</span></span> </span><span id="xfxy25"  style="color:#000000;">White</span><strong>:</strong></span> Nothing in life and work is laid out in black and white. Nothing is clear-cut, and some assumptions are far from the truth. Sadly though,perceptions are often based on assumptions. It's assumed that women can't be as good at numbers while men aren't meant to be in the MUSINGS kitchen. It's assumed that bosses need to be feared and employees need to toe the line. Why base your perceptions on such retrograde assumptions?<br id="xfxy26">Question assumptions, but don't prejudice your views. Beware of perceptions that stem from stereotypes about people, cultures, races and sex, because they are misleading. People who reassess the way they see things are most likely to succeed.<br id="xfxy27"><br id="xfxy28"><span style="font-size:100%;"><span id="xfxy29"  style="color:#b5d1d7;"><b>Examining Grey</b></span>:</span> Once we know that life cannot be categorised into black and white, we need to examine the grey areas.Perceptions will differ and it is the wise person who realises that there may be morethan one way of looking at things. For accurate perceptions, we need to listen and understand others' viewpoints. We need to examine what falls between the extremes. Perceptions would become more accurate and complete if we are objective enough to look at things from all possible angles. Success in life and work lies in your ability to perceive various possibilities.<br id="xfxy30"><br id="xfxy31"><span style="font-size:100%;"><span id="xfxy32"  style="color:#00ff80;"><span style="color:#00ff00;"><b>Turning Green</b></span></span>:</span> In office, some people do better than others. Rather than turn green with envy at their promotions, think how they got better. The perception that the only way up the corporate ladder is by pleasing the boss and looking good is a limiting one. Do not be judgemental about people based on what you see. If someone makes you uncomfortable,look inwards.It could be your perception about yourself.You might be seeing yourself as an under-achiever and inefficient person. Change how you perceive yourself. Achievers have high self-esteem because they believe they are capable and worth their salt.<br id="xfxy33"><br id="xfxy34">Exploring the <span id="xfxy35"  style="color:#ff00ff;"><span style="font-size:100%;"><b>rose</b></span> </span>tinted: Life through rose- tinted glasses looks better. People, who think success, see success. Base your perceptions on the bigger and rosy picture that's how successful people have achieved their goals. The idea is to align your perception to a higher plane that would give you a clearer vision. Right perception nurturi the right attitude to solve problems and take decisions. Think Success. Think Big. Think right. You can't be sure of others' perceptions as you can be of your own. That is all the more important for you to make your perceptions i accurate as possible. The more accurate you;perceptions are, the more accurate your actions will be. Mix the shades of life situations and stand back to perceive a masterpiece. Your perceptions will put thing;in the right perspective. Then it's for you to decide whether to take a sad song and make it better or just weep. Or spin gold out of ha'rather than just see it as a haystack.<br id="xfxy36"></span><br /></dt><p class="post-body "><br /><br /><br /><br /></p><div class="blogger-post-footer">Joe's Blog</div>
