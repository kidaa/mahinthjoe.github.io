<span style="color:#ff9966;">I love you<br />Not for what you are,<br />But for what I am when I am with you.<br /><br />I love you<br />Not only for what you have made for yourself<br />But for what you are making of me.<br /><br />I love you<br />For putting your hand into my heaped up heart<br />And passing over all the foolish weak things<br /><br />That you cant help dimly seeing there<br />And drawing into the light<br />All the beautiful belongings<br />That no one else had looked<br />Quite far enough to find.<br /><br />You have done it, Without a touch<br />Without a word, Without a sign<br /><br />You have done it, by being yourself<br />Perhaps that is what being a "Friend" means. </span><div class="blogger-post-footer">Joe's Blog</div>
