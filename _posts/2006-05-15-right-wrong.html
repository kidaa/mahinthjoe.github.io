'Wrong' is purely a matter of self-realisation. That's why most of the times when you tell others that they are wrong they snap back saying <span style="font-weight: bold;">"You are wrong in saying that I am wrong"</span>.Let us not be angry that we are not able to make others what we we wish them to be, we are not even able to make even own selves what we wish to be. Our primary responsibility is not to transform the world but to transform ourselves.<br /><div style="text-align: right;">Voice of Love, ' Frozen Thoughts'<br /><div style="text-align: left;"><br /></div> </div><div class="blogger-post-footer">Joe's Blog</div>
