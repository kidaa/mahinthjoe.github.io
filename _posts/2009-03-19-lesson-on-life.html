One day, the father of a very wealthy family took his son on a trip to the country with the express purpose of showing him how poor people live.<br /><br />They spent a couple of days and nights on the farm of what would be considered a very poor family.<br /><br />On their return from their trip, the father asked his son, “How was the trip?”<br /> ”It was great, Dad.”<br /><br />“Did you see how poor people live?” the father asked.<br /><br />“Oh yeah,” said the son.<br /><br />“So, tell me, what did you learn from the trip?” asked the father.<br />The son answered:<br /><br />“I saw that we have one dog and they had four.<br />We have a pool that reaches to the middle of our garden and they have a creek that has no end.We have imported lanterns in our garden and they have the stars at night.<br />Our patio reaches to the front yard and they have the whole horizon.<br />We have a small piece of land to live on and they have fields that go beyond our sight.<br />We have servants who serve us, but they serve others.<br />We buy our food, but they grow theirs.<br />We have walls around our property to protect us, they have friends to protect them.”<br /><br />The boy’s father was speechless.<br /><br />Then his son added, “Thanks Dad for showing me how poor we are.”<br /><br />Isn’t perspective a wonderful thing? Makes you wonder what would happen if we all gave thanks for everything we have, instead of worrying about what we don’t have.<br /><br /><strong>Appreciate every single thing you have, especially your friends!</strong><div class="blogger-post-footer">Joe's Blog</div>
