<span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">Many of the professional schools are like employment exchanges.</span> They provide 'Hire Education'. An academy that trains young people in hotel management teaches the students the art of grroming a personality for making a career in the industry. <span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">The abiding philosophy is: fake it until you make it</span>. After that you can show the company your canine teeth.<br />The MBA churning mills also enter into alliances with companies in the game of mutual deception. The <span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">MBA is an acronym for Mind Boggling Aspiration</span> - often without minimum professional accumen. Companaies recruit to keep the MBA education industry on a perpetual growth path. Strangely no MBA school worth its salt can show any positive corelation between success in the MBA programme and success as a manger.<br />The MBA curiculum is about knowing the business as a system of knowledge. In that, most good business schools do a fairly commendable job. MBA's learn to write decent business plans and analyse case studies of successful systems. But successful systems are bvy and large slow to respond to change. Ironically, a managers job success is very often about delivering inspite of the system. So we now know why so many MBA toppers do not succeed as well in their role as mangers.<br />Hire education is about finding employment. It is unfortunately not about higher levels of personal effectiveness or professional competence. Befor you fire a non-performing manager, think about firing this hire education.<br /><br /><span style="font-size:85%;"><span style="FONT-STYLE: italic">Success Sutras In Times Of India 29 Nov'06 <a href="http://www.debchat.com/index.php">Dr Debasish Chatterjee</a>.
