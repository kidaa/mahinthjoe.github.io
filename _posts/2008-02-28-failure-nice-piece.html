For I have spent my life failing. My failures have not been once in a lifetime event. They have been too numerous even to begin listing them here. Let me brag a bit more. My failures have never been ordinary failures. Whenever I failed, I was literally on the street not knowing where my next meal would come from. </p><p>Jim Rohn, the foremost success and motivational guru of our century, and a person I admire most, once said failures should conduct seminars so that we can learn from their failures. That is why I got inspired to write this piece. </p><p><strong>Failure is celebration time!</strong> </p><p>The history is full of people who failed even thousands of times and what they did with those failures have made humankind lead a life which would have been unimaginable but for those failures. Whether it be Thomas Edison or a Colonel Sanders, their failure have created products and lifestyles which have changed the way the world lives. </p><p>Therefore, what happens when a determined individual fails and how does failures ultimately become a celebration? </p><p><strong>People who fail often are natural leaders </strong></p><p>Leaders Do. They re-do. They do not wait for precedence and play safe. They are looking at the future and willing to take calculated risks to embrace a future that would make life better for others. They are perfectly willing to fail in the bargain. They take responsibility for their failures and learn from it. They have passion for what they do and improve upon their failures and persist until they make a success of it. </p><p><strong>People who fail learn more </strong></p><p>The leaders thrive on failures. They in fact seem to welcome and embrace it. Because they know they can make a difference, they never fear failure. They persevere in spite of failures. Every failure for them is learning on how not to do something or how to do it better. For the achievers failure is the way of life. Every failure makes them that much more determined to succeed. </p><p><strong>Failure as a weapon </strong></p><p>Failure is a weapon for true blue leaders. They learn the disciplines through their failures. They sharpen themselves against the grindstone of failure. There is no excuse for failure, only a determination to succeed. </p><p><strong>Failures programs you to success </strong></p><p>Every failure has a built in mechanism to auto correct and reprograms you for success. Therefore, failures are just a way of programming you to improved success. You only need to activate the auto correct mechanism and give it all you got for it to work successfully. </p><p><strong><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">Fear of failure is the biggest roadblock to your success</span></strong>. When you have overcome the fear of failure, you have overcome your procrastination and excuses for inaction. Thereafter you are well on your way to fail, learn, and succeed like never before. </p><p>If you have started to fail is not it time for celebration? You are already well on the road to success! </p><p>R.G. Srinivasan is a managerial professional, Writer and Author.
