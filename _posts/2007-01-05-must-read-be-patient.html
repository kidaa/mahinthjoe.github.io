Just came across this early today. Thought it's something that would sure make us think. Must Read!<br /><br />A man came out of his home to admire his new truck. To his puzzlement, his three-year-old son was happily hammering dents into the shiny paint. The man ran to his son, knocked him away, and hammered the little boy's hands into a pulp as punishment. When the father calmed down, he rushed his son to the hospital. Although the doctor tried desperately to save the crushed bones, he finally had to amputate the fingers from both the boy's hands. When the boy woke up from the surgery and saw his bandaged stubs, he innocently said, "Daddy, I'm sorry about your truck." Then he asked, "but when are my fingers going to grow back..?" The father went home and committed suicide.<br /><br />Think about the story the next time you see someone spilled milk at a dinner table or hear a baby cry. Think first before you lose your patience and become angry with someone you love. Trucks can be repaired. Broken bones and hurt feelings often cannot. Too often we fail to recognize the difference between the person and the performance. People make mistakes. We are allowed to make mistakes. But the actions we take while in a rage will haunt us forever. Pause and ponder. Think before you act. Be patientâ€¦<br /><br /><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">PEOPLE HAVE THE RIGHT TO BE ANGRY, BUT THEY HAVE NO RIGHT TO BE CRUEL...</span><br /><br /><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold"></span><div class="blogger-post-footer">Joe's Blog</div>
