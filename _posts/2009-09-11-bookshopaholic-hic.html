<p>I have a humble confession to make. I believe in the Quote <span style="font-weight:bold;">'An idle mind is a devils workshop'</span> . Thinking about myself, on,  <span style="font-weight:bold;">how bad I am</span>. Whenever the situation leading to it arises I rush out to the nearest mall, bookstall anywhere doing anything which will keep this wayward mind of mine  occupied not necessarily buying something but  just rummaging through the book stalls and reading everything that interests me between life & death. It was in one of these escapades that I came across this nice little story.</p><p>The topic I read in it was a small story of two samurai's one the master & the other student. Well as far as I can recollect the story goes like this the student asks the master a simple description of heaven & hell. At this the master jokingly replied Ha Ha You are undergoing the samurai training by not even knowing this. At this joke the student samurai took out his sword and was ready to strike out at his master, at which the master calmly replied <span style="font-weight:bold;">"this is hell"</span>. The student suddenly realized his fault sheathed the sword and began to ask his master for forgiveness, that when the master remarked <span style="font-weight:bold;">"this is heaven"</span>.</p><p>If you don't take the time to control your thoughts they will control you. When you control your thoughts, you control your mind. When you control your mind, you control your life. And once you reach the state of being in total control of your life, you become the master of your destiny. An abundance of willpower and discipline is one of the chief attributes of all those with strong characters and wonderful lives. Willpower allows you to to what you said you would do, when you said you would do it. Its willpower that allows you to get up at five in the morning to cultivate your mind through meditation or to feed your spirit by a walk in the woods when a cozy bed beacons you on a cold winter's day. It's willpower that holds your tongue when a less actualized person insults you or does something you disagree with. It's willpower that pushes your dreams forward when the odds appear to be insurmountable. It's willpower that offers you the inner power to keep your commitments to others, and, perhaps more importantly to yourself.</p><p><iframe src="http://rcm.amazon.com/e/cm?t=m0ba5-20&o=1&p=8&l=bpl&asins=0062515675&fc1=000000&IS2=1&lt1=_blank&m=amazon&lc1=0000FF&bc1=000000&bg1=FFFFFF&f=ifr" style="align:left;padding-top:5px;width:131px;height:245px;padding-right:10px;"align="left" scrolling="no" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" frameborder="0"></iframe><br />With extracts from 'A Unknown Book', 'The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari', and the 'blogging workshop'</p><a href="javascript:window.location = 'http://www.socialmarker.com/?link='+encodeURIComponent (location.href)+'&title='+encodeURIComponent( document.title);"><img src= "http://www.socialmarker.com/bookmark.gif" border="0" alt="share" /></a><noscript><a href="http://www.socialmarker.com">Social Bookmarking</a></noscript><div class="blogger-post-footer">Joe's Blog</div>
