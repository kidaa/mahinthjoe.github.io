<h2 align="center"><span style="font-family:Verdana;"><b>Joe's The Devil </b></span></h2><br /><br /><br /><p align="center"><span style="font-family:Verdana;">Materiality. Material Force. Material temptation; sometimes obsession </span></p><br /><br /><br /><p align="center"><span style="font-family:Verdana;">The Devil is often a great card for business success; hard work and ambition.</span></p><br /><br /><br /><p align="center"><span style="font-family:Verdana;"><strong>Perhaps the most misunderstood of all the major arcana</strong>, the Devil is not really "Satan" at all, but Pan the half-goat nature god and/or Dionysius. These are gods of pleasure and abandon, of wild behavior and unbridled desires. This is a card about ambitions; it is also synonymous with temptation and addiction. On the flip side, however, the card can be a warning to someone who is too restrained, someone who never allows themselves to get passionate or messy or wild - or ambitious. This, too, is a form of enslavement. As a person, the Devil can stand for a man of money or erotic power, aggressive, controlling, or just persuasive. <span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">This is not to say a bad man, but certainly a powerful man who is hard to resist.</span> <strong style="FONT-WEIGHT: normal">The important thing is to remember that any chain is freely worn. In most cases, you are enslaved only because you allow it.</strong></span></p><br /><br /><br /><p align="center"><span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:85%;"><b>What Tarot Card are You?</b><br /><a href="http://www.flarn.com/~warlock/tarot" target="_blank">Take the Test to Find Out.</a></span></p><br /><p align="left"><span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:85%;">To Read Times Of India <a href="http://epaper.timesofindia.com/Repository/ml.asp?Ref=VE9JTS8yMDA3LzEyLzAxI0FyMDE3MDU=&amp;Mode=HTML&amp;Locale=english-skin-custom">Article</a> (Tip: Right Click link and select open in new window) on Dec 2 2007 </span></p><div class="blogger-post-footer">Joe's Blog</div>
