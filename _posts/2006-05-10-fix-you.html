I dont know whether I am addicted to this song or my emotions are taking me for a ride or I am just plain crazy. As per the song there is no "You" formally but lights do guide me home! Still trying to figure it out. Just hoping for the best, that being a perfect example of my optimism.<br /><object width="425" height="350"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/rQT_e_lHIrU"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/rQT_e_lHIrU" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="425" height="350"></embed></object><br />Artist : Coldplay<br />Song Name:Fix You<br /><br />When you try your best, but you don’t succeed<br />When you get what you want, but not what you need<br />When you feel so tired, but you can’t sleep<br />Stuck in reverse<br />When the tears come streaming down your face<br />When you lose something you can’t replace<br />When you love someone, but it goes to waste<br />Could it be worse?<br />Lights will guide you home<br />And ignite your bones<br />And I will try to fix you<br /><br />High up above or down below<br />When you too in love to let it go<br />If you never try you’ll never know<br />Just watch and learn<br /><br />Lights will guide you home<br />And ignite your bones<br />And I will try to fix you<div class="blogger-post-footer">Joe's Blog</div>
